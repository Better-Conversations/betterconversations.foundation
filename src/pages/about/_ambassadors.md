Virginia McKendry, Ph.D. - https://www.linkedin.com/in/virginia-mckendry-ph-d-3465b51b/
Suggested Specialties: Academic Research, Communication Studies, Adult Learning

Associate Faculty at Royal Roads University

Dr. Virginia McKendry is an interdisciplinary scholar whose work traces the ways cultural systems of meaning are transmitted and (trans)formed through everyday texts, images, conversations, practices, institutions and material objects. Her graduate research in British social and cultural history drew substantially from the fields of visual communication and cultural studies, as well as critical theories of gender and class. Her interest in narrative, generative communication and complex systems frameworks connects her various research interests, including: the meaning of monarchy in modern age, women's experiences of public leadership, the history of women in Canadian public relations, and collaborative forms of leadership and cultural development. Her research draws on a range of qualitative methods - from archival research to storytelling and arts-based interventions, to cooperative action research. 

As an educator, she has dedicated her career to developing and delivering adult learning experiences that integrate academic, professional and ethical mastery. Currently, she teaches graduate-level courses in research methods and climate communication. 

Experience
McKendry earned a master's degree in Women's Studies (SFU) in 1991 and a PhD in British History (York) in 1994. Before joining Royal Roads in 2010, she served as a core faculty member at Wilfrid Laurier University and as a contract faculty member at Fanshawe College.  She then served for 11 years as a core faculty member and program head in the School of Communication and Culture at RRU.  

She retired in 2021, but continues to work part-time as a course developer, instructor, thesis advisor, and researcher. Currently, she is conducting research into how Clean Language (David Grove's work) and emergent knowledge processes impact student learning. Her work outside of the academy has included applied communication roles in web development, public relations, course development for private companies, and citizen engagement initiatives aimed at preventing violence against women and children.

About
𝐁𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐌𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐌𝐚𝐜𝐆𝐲𝐯𝐞𝐫 • 𝐇𝐢𝐠𝐡-𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐟𝐢𝐝𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐞 • 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐜 𝐏𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐧𝐞𝐫 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐅𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬

I work with founders under fire to build mentally tough leaders, unstoppable sales teams and maximize business growth. 

The great result: a business that runs like a well-oiled machine and a founder/CEO who can stop fighting fires 𝐢𝐧 their business and start focusing 𝐨𝐧 their business and strategic growth. 

I’m Dr Robyn, I’m here for the challenges you don't talk about. My clients often feel overworked, undervalued, or underestimated. They’re juggling high expectations while facing personal battles they aren't sure how to navigate.

Think of me as your private, high-performance confidante. A strategic partner to tackle your toughest personal and professional challenges. My approach is direct, judgment-free, and confidential. We’ll cut through the mental clutter and find practical solutions fast.

Whether it's confronting the 3 AM demons or navigating high-stakes decisions that come with leadership, we’ll build the clarity, confidence, and resilience you need to move forward with purpose and power. Call me when you need to think clearly under pressure, make bold moves, and turn insight into action.

𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐌𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐬 𝐌𝐞 𝐃𝐢𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐭
I have a doctorate in business psychology with a concentration in high performance and sport and I’ve lived through chaos myself. I know firsthand how to pivot quickly, think critically, and survive under pressure. My clients appreciate that I get it. I don’t waste their time with vague advice.

I’m also a former competitive beach volleyball player and no stranger to high stakes, quick thinking, and relentless focus. This blend of real-world experience and psychological expertise shapes my unique approach.

𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐂𝐥𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬 𝐂𝐡𝐨𝐨𝐬𝐞 𝐌𝐞
My clients are successful, high-energy, and intensely private. They value direct, actionable guidance from someone who understands high-pressure situations. They’ve often tried traditional coaching or therapy but found it lacking: generic advice from someone who doesn’t understand doesn’t cut it.
 
𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐂𝐥𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬 𝐒𝐚𝐲
“I love that I can talk through sticky, messy things with you; be unsure, even lost, and it doesn’t negatively affect my stock price.”

If you’re ready to silence the internal chaos, think clearly under pressure, and accelerate your business, let’s connect.

Barb Collombin - https://www.linkedin.com/in/barb-collombin/
Suggested Specialties: Academic Leadership, Strategic Communications, Organisational Culture

AboutAbout
My passions are learning and helping people and organizations thrive – I develop leaders through facilitation, connection, and coaching.

University is a space for knowledge, growth, and connections. I help my students discover which path to choose so that their skills, talents, and visions point them toward a rewarding career where they can be their best selves.

In addition to my teaching role as Associate Faculty at RRU, I use my vast network to bring students, organizations, communication theory, and practice together as the Coordinator for the MAPC Organization Communication Challenge. It’s a live-case challenge where clients pitch communication challenges to student teams, who, in turn, work to create communication strategies that address them. 

Our students analyze the communication channels, culture, and processes and apply learned change management strategies to real-world problems. Companies, non-profits, and the public sector are presented with creative solutions to help reach their stakeholders, deliver their missions, engage their employees, and strengthen their culture. 

I love being creative in the classroom and bringing innovation, risk, and a new way of doing things to my curriculum. Education and the field of communications are always changing; staying on top of current trends in teaching and businesses is a challenge, but where I thrive.
