If you're reading this, you're probably interested in learning how to
deliver the Better Conversations course. You'll find a lot of information
here, and we hope it's helpful. We've tried to keep it simple and easy to
refer back to. 

We do add content to this site regularly, so please check back often. If
you have any questions, please ask us.

------------------
About this section 
------------------

There are some technical terms and concepts in the course, but we've tried
to explain them as clearly as we can. If you're not sure about something,
please ask us or post a question in the Community forum.

We've tried to make the documentation as easy to use as we can. We've used
a consistent structure and layout, and we've included lots of links to
other parts of the documentation. We've also included a glossary of terms.

If you're new to the course, we recommend that you start with the Course
Overview. This will give you a good idea of what the course is about and
how it's structured.

For those of you who have been on the course, you might want to start with
the `Flight Plans </documentation/course-materials/flight_plans.html>`_.
These are the detailed plans for each session, and they include all the
information you need to deliver each module, along with the Course
Handbook.

Note that for some of the content you'll need to sign in with your email
address.

Sometimes you need to link to a page that is not going to change, perhaps to send out to your course
participants or post in forums. No one likes a broken link!

This is a list of links that are stable and will not change, and will redirect the user to the 
current correct page. So as we issue new flight plans reorganise the site, 
https://betterconversations.foundation/l/flightplans will always take you to the current list of flight plans.

Design Patterns
===============

As we develop this course, we spot things that are helpful to know. We call
these "design patterns", a term borrowed from the world of software.

You might be wondering why we're sharing these design patterns. We want to be
transparent about how we've designed the course, and to help you understand why
we have made certain decisions about the way we deliver the course. We also
want to encourage you to think about how you might design your own courses. You
can reuse these patterns, or adapt them to your own needs.

On first glance, this might seem like unnecessary detail. However, we believe
that when you deliver the course yourself, you will be able to make better
informed decisions about what suits your audience and your context.

We continue to improve the course; if you have any suggestions for changes or
additional patterns, please let us know.



.. todo:: Add the following patterns to the toctree above.

Template Pattern Name
=====================

Copy this file to create a new pattern file. Replace `template-pattern` with
the short name of the pattern. Add an introduction to the pattern here. This
should be a brief overview of the pattern and what it does. List any synonyms
for the pattern here.

e.g. this is a template pattern. It is used to create a new design pattern
file. It is a reStructuredText file with a specific structure.

There's no need to fill in every section if it's not relevant to the pattern.
However it will be useful to fill in as much as possible. Each section has
prompts to help you fill it in. Delete the prompts once you've answered them.

.. todo:: 
      
      CD and perhaps SC to do :-) 

      Mainly this is a general discussion of how/why we use flipcharts. 
      The detailed examples should be versioned along with the flight plans

      Note that the facilitator standing up and writing on the flipchart means

      - They can put more energy into the group just by standing up and moving
      - They can control the pace of the group by writing slowly or quickly
      - They can let someone know their contribution has been heard by writing it down, 
        and it is time to stop by turning around and putting the cap on their pen
        



### File: documentation/design-patterns/Breakout-Rooms.rst

===================
Zoom Breakout Rooms
===================
.. warning::
   
   This page is under construction. 


.. todo:: Video here, and also explain what the breakout rooms do for us. 


We use Breakout Rooms to facilitate small group discussions. Generally
each Better Conversations module has two sections where participants go
into Breakout Rooms.

Some exercises will take longer e.g. practising 2-3 questions. Therefore 
the second breakout may be longer than the first…


Breakout Room Construction
--------------------------

If you have a Producer
++++++++++++++++++++++


Solo Facilitators
+++++++++++++++++

If you don't have a producer 


Follow up From A Breakout Room
------------------------------



Breakout Room Composition
-------------------------


Timings and Notifications
-------------------------

Giving a minute longer for me is to give them a minute longer to get to 
know each other on top of what you think each exercise should take. 
This will need to happen again if you change the groups for subsequent breakouts.






Assign breakouts based on state checkin. Post breakout 1, factor in how the individuals are engaging.

Change the groups only if the subsequent exercises don’t depend on the first one e.g. if it doesn’t involve continuing the conversation.

Change the breakout groups if someone is clearly not engaging or has a tech issue or other need. Consider keeping them in the main room to work with the facilitator on the exercise.

If you know a participant is neurodiverse, consider how to make the questions more meaningful and accessible e.g. by narrowing the context.


### File: documentation/design-patterns/flight-plan-pattern.rst

============
Flight Plans
============

Flight plans are the key to delivering Better Conversations. We've crystallized
both the contents and the structure of these over the years, and they reliably
deliver a quality outcome for us. Flight plans are effectively a state
management tool.

We publish our flight plans so other people can benefit from this work. It also
means that, you can see how we work and what we do, and you can see how we are
improving over time. Our Experience Courses run to the flight plans we publish
or are in the process of testing - which means you know what to expect when you
partner with us.

-----------------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`construction;1.8rem` Using this Pattern
-----------------------------------------------------------

Flight plans are used to deliver a consistent Better Conversations experience
for all involved. They ensure:

- A common script for the delivery team and Observers to follow and discuss.
- The delivery team is well-prepared and have talked before the session starts about how they are going to work together. 
- The learning objectives are met and the session is focused (we have a lot of content to cover in a short time).
- New facilitators or producers are supported in their learning and development.
- A basis for continuous improvement, as we review the flight plan after the 
session and see what worked and what didn't.

The drawbacks are that currently they are time-consuming to create and
maintain, and they can be seen as constraining. We have to be careful to
balance the need for consistency with the need for creativity and flexibility.

The alternative is to not use a flight plan, and to rely on the experience and
intuition of the delivery team. This can work, but it is less reliable and
makes the faciltator and producer roles much harder. It also makes it harder to
bring new people into the team. All these things can significantly degrade the
participant experience.

-----------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`dashboard;1.8rem` Structure
-----------------------------------------------

Flight plans contain:

- All the logistical information for the session, such as date and time, the
Zoom link, who is faciliating, who is producing

- Brief notes for the faciliator and producer on how to run the session
- Checklists of the key things to prepare and discuss, individually and as a team
- The learning objectives for the session, and possible extensions
- A detailed time plan with activities for each member of the delivery team
- Information for the producer on breakout rooms, and what to put in Zoom chat
- A detailed script for the facilitator to follow

The flight plans themselves contain design patterns. We have a design pattern
for each of the key components of the flight plan, such as the time plan, the
script, the learning objectives, and so on. Each section in the time plan is
also a design pattern e.g. the way we facilitate a discussion, the way we check
in on state, the way we use a breakout room are all patterns in themselves

This means that we can improve the flight plan by improving the design
patterns, and we can use the design patterns in other contexts - which means
you can do the same!

-------------------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`groups;1.8rem` Roles and Responsibilities
-------------------------------------------------------------

Currently, there are a number of roles described in the flight plans:

- **Facilitator 1 and 2**: The people who are co-leading the session. Facilitator 2 is a role we can use to develop new facilitators.

- **Producer**: The person who is running the Zoom session, and who is responsible for the technical aspects of the session.

- **Observer**: The person who is observing the session, usually in preparation for delivering the course, and/or training as a facilitator or producer.

- **Participants**: The people who are attending the session. Also referred as "attendees".

- **Sponsor**: Responsible for the outcomes of the session, in terms of "Why are we doing this?" and "What are we trying to achieve?". 

  - For the Foundation, this is generally one of the directors or a Foundation Ambassador. 
  - When a course is delivered in a company it will be the person who comissioned the course, or their delegate. 

One thing we have learned is to be very aware of the role(s) we are in, and to
be clear about what we are doing in each moment and why. 

Of course, not all these roles will apply if you are delivering the session in
a different context. For example, if you are delivering a session to a small
group, you may not need two facilitators. If you are using the flight plans to
coach someone one-to-one, you will not need a producer. If you are delivering a
session to a very large group, you may need more than one producer.


--------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`content_paste;1.8rem` Examples
--------------------------------------------------

You can find the latest published flight plans `here
<https://betterconversations.foundation/documentation/course-materials/flight_plans.html>`_.


-------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`science;1.8rem` Testing
-------------------------------------------

We are on a continual learning and improvement loop every time we run a
session. We gather observations and feedback from the delivery team and the
participants, and we use this to improve the flight plans. 

We test updated flight plans by running live sessions, documenting the results
and any feedback from the delivery team. We might run test a completely new
module with a small group of participants, one faciliator and one producer and
one or two observers.

----------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`touch_app;1.8rem` Implementation
----------------------------------------------------

We keep master versions of the flight plans, which only the Foundation team
have access to. We make a copy of the master flight plan for each live session.
The delivery team all work from the same live flight plan, which is kept in a
shared folder.

This is so we have a clear documentation trail between master versions and live
flight plans. We can also make changes to the flight plan for that live session
without affecting other live sessions or the masters.

This might be overkill for you, but it matters when you are working with
different delivery teams, running a lot of sessions and trying to improve the
flight plans over time. It also helps when working with different clients, as
we can tailor the session to their needs.

-------------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`sticky_note_2;1.8rem` Anything else
------------------------------------------------------- 

We used to include the following sections, but have moved these to other
documents and tools. Some of these features have been removed for data
protection reasons, as we are now working with external clients:

- Participant list to check who is expected to be in the session and who attended
- Copies of the flipcharts used in the session (before and after views)
- Copies of the breakout room groups
- Copies of the chat messages
- Observations we made during the session

.. todo::

   - as we do this more and more, we realise it doesn't matter what happened in the session
   - follow the patterns and it'll be fine 
   - we don't need to document every single thing that happens in the session

===============
Email Templates
===============

When we run our "Experience Courses" our system has some standard 
email templates. We've been asked to share them so here you are...

- The Invite Wording for each Module
- The follow up Fieldwork Wording for each Module
- Examples of our Pre- and Post-Session Emails
- Our Welcome Email

--------------
Invite Wording
--------------

Firstly, we have some standard wording for each module

Module 1 (State)
  To help you prepare for this module, think about conversations you would like to 
  be better as a result of this course.

  Can you give those conversations a name or a label to remember them easily?

  We will also explore a key factor in having Better Conversations - our State.

Module 2 (Assumptions)
  We'll be exploring how quickly and easily we make Assumptions, and the link to State.
      
  Please have a pen and some paper with you as we will be doing some drawing. Don't worry, there won't be a competition for best artwork!

Module 3 (Context)
  In this module, we will consider Context, and how you bring meaning to a conversation.

  To help you prepare, please think about a conversation you'd like to be better. What you would like to have happen in that conversation?

Module 4 (Listening with Curiosity)
  In this module, we will practice Listening with Curiosity, and how you can influence a conversation.

  To help you prepare, please think about a conversation you'd like to be better. What you would like to have happen in that conversation?


Module 5 (Intentional Conversations)
  This module introduces Intentional Conversations, and why our intentions for a conversation are only half the story.

  To help you prepare, please think about a conversation you'd like to be better. What you would like to have happen in that conversation?


-----------------
Fieldwork Wording
-----------------

After the session we send them an email "As a reminder here's the suggested fieldwork from the session"

Module 1 (State)
  - Notice your state, and how and when it changes for you.
  - Try mapping it to the Traffic Light Model.
  - What's your state like, before and after your conversations?

Module 2 (Assumptions)
  - Try noticing what you are seeing or hearing when you are interacting with someone.
  - What assumptions are you making in your interactions?
  -	Are your assumptions accurate?

Module 3 (Context)
  - Try noticing what context you bring to a conversation

Pre- and Post-Session Emails
----------------------------

These are the emails we slot this text into. As you can see they
are very standardised and we've just copy and pasted from 
the app that runs bettercourses.org so there's still code in there.
But hopefully that makes it easier to see how it all fits together.


This is the email we send out before the session. It's a reminder of the session details, and the fieldwork from the session before.

.. code-block:: none

  Hi <%= @attendance.user.first_name %>,

  We hope you are excited for Module <%= @attendance.zoom_session.module_number %> of Better Conversations today.

  <% unless @module_text_prep.empty? %>
  <%= @module_text_prep %>
  <% end %>

  <% unless @module_text_prev_fieldwork.empty? %>
  <%= @module_text_prev_fieldwork %>
  <% end %>

  You can see the session details, join the Zoom meeting, download the
  handbook, and more here <%= live_view_attendance_url(uuid:

-----------------
The Welcome Email
-----------------

This is our standard welcome email people get when they sign up. 

.. code-block:: none

  Hi <%= @user.first_name %>,

  Thank you for signing up for Better Conversations. You should have been
  taken to a page where you can book a course at time convenient to you.

  Note that all the times you see in emails from us and on the web site are
  in your local time zone, which we believe to be <%= @timezone %>. We will
  send calendar invites for the sessions you have booked with the Zoom
  meeting details.

  If that's wrong, or you have any questions, please do get in touch at
  hello@betterconversations.foundation. 

  To make the most of the course, we recommend doing a few things before
  each session:

  - Connect using a laptop or desktop device. Zoom functionality is limited
    on a mobile devices (such as access to the Chat function in Breakout
    Rooms)

  - Ensure you have the latest version of Zoom on your device

  - Join us from a quiet place where you are unlikely to be disturbed 

  - Make sure that we can see and hear you clearly as this is a interactive
    class. We can help with this if you join us 5-10 minutes before the
    session.

  - Make use of the automatic captions in Zoom. You can also view live
    transcriptions in languages supported by Zoom.

  We've compiled some tips for online meetings at
  https://betterconversations.foundation/documentation/public/Online%20Meeting%20Guidelines.pdf

  If you are unfamiliar with Zoom, you can find guidelines on joining a
  meeting at

### File: documentation/course-materials/flight_plans.rst

============
Flight Plans
============

Designed to be used by the course delivery team, our "Flight Plans" are the detailed 
instructions for running the course. We use them every time we run the course and
consider them to be the most important part of the material we are making available.

We are also constantly improving them based on feedback from the course delivery teams.
You'll see that the flight plans are versioned. You can find the change log at the bottom
of this page. 

Don't feel you need to update to every version. Check the change notes to see
if you want to update your version. Most of the time the changes are small and
we hope helpful.

If you're delivering a course for the Foundation you'll be using the latest versions
of the flight plans.

.. todo::

    - Something about the flight plans, linking to the page
    - For more information see each module
    - Link back for more information
    - Link to the course delivery team
    - Link to versioning 
    - Add flipchart pictures PPT file to the download?

----------------------
Using the Flight Plans
----------------------

We distribute the flight plans as PDFs. If you want to edit them you can just open 
the PDF in Word.

The Foundation has historically used Word files stored on Sharepoint, which allows
the delivery team to all work off the same copy. We are phasing this out and moving
to the Delivery Console.

------------------------
Getting the Flight Plans
------------------------

To get the latest flight plans, go to
`https://bettercourses.org/flightplans
<https://bettercourses.org/flightplans>`_ and choose the version, page
size, and style you want. You'll then get an email with the PDFs attached,
customised especially for you. 


---------------------
Historic Flight Plans
---------------------

As of September 2024, we're no longer updating the change log here.

If you want to know what's changed, from version 3.0 onwards you can check
out the `GitHub repository
<https://github.com/Better-Conversations/flightplan-sources/releases>`_.

If you need a copy of the flight plans before version 3.0, please contact

Google Calendar Invites & Privacy
=================================

.. warning::
   
   This page is under construction. 

-----------
The Problem
-----------

We generally send course attendees a Google Calendar invite for each module, with the
Zoom details in etc. 

If you do this the obvious way, this means everyone can see each other's email address
and you might not want that for privacy and other reasons. 

Here's how to set your Google Meeting up so guest email addresses remain private. 

---------------------
Creating your meeting
---------------------

Add your guests as normal and then click on the "Guest Permissions".

.. image:: images/google-meeting.png

-----------------
Guest Permissions
-----------------

Then you will see something like this

.. image:: images/google-meeting-permissions-before.png

------------------------
The Permissions you want
------------------------

Unckeck all the boxes

.. image:: images/google-meeting-permissions-after.png

Making this the default
-----------------------

If you want you can "Set as default" so those settings are used for all Google Meetings.

    We don't need a recording to give to people who have missed a session as they can
    always redo. 


The first few minutes the producer says

After introductions, If RECORDING, say:

We will be recording this session for internal learning and training. Please give us a thumbs up if you’re OK with this or thumbs down if you’re not. Please only share what you feel is appropriate to share in this group.

### File: documentation/course-design/index.rst

Course Design
=============

Design is a term that can mean different things, such as:

- The **purpose, intention, or goal** of something
- The **creation, planning, or arrangement** of an object, a process, or a 
system, according to a specific purpose, function, or context.
- The **plan behind** an action, fact, or object.
- A **pattern** or a **style** of something.

Design is about finding better ways to do things. It's both a science and an
art, a blend of logic, analysis, and utility, as well as intuition,
imagination, and creativity.


Design principles guide our decisions
-------------------------------------

We've also developed a set of design principles that guide our decisions. These
principles are based on our understanding of how adults learn, and on our
experience of designing and delivering other courses. The principles are:

**Separate information from learning**: We've designed the course to separate
information from learning, so that participants can learn by doing, and by
reflecting on what they've done. We've designed the course to be delivered in a
way that encourages participants to engage with the material, with each other,
and with the facilitator.

**The magic happens in the conversations**: We've designed the course to focus
on the conversations that participants have with each other, and with the
facilitator. We've designed the course to be delivered in a way that encourages
participants to engage with the material, with each other, and with the
facilitator.

**Keep it simple**: We've designed the course to explain the models and
concepts in 5 minutes or less, so that participants can understand and remember
what they've learned.

**Think systemically**: We've always tried to think a few steps ahead, to
dare to dream big and to think about our overall mission. Some of the decisions
we've may seem odd or unnecessary at first, but they are all part of a
longer-term plan. You can always ask us if you're not sure why we've done
something a particular way!

**Always be learning**: We have a tight learning loop, where we gather
feedback, reflect on it, and make changes. We're always looking for ways to
improve the course, and we're always learning from our experiences.

**Know when to be systematic** Whilst learning and adaptation requires an
ability to hold many things in play at once, there are times when it is helpful
to standardise and introduce consistency. We've built systems, processes and
tools that help us to deliver the course in a reliable and scalable way.

Design constraints
------------------

We've decided to work within certain constraints. It may seem counterintuitive,
but these constraints actually help us to be more creative and to make better
decisions. For example:

**We deliver the course online**: This means that we can reach a global
audience, and also reach people who might be working remotely or who might not
be able to travel to a training course.

**We deliver the course in 6 modules**: This means that we have to be
selective about what we include in the course. It also means there are
opportunities for people who want to go deeper to do so, by adding extra modules
that are tailored to their audience.

**Each module is delivered in one hour**: This means that we have to be
concise and focused in the way we deliver the course. It's led to a repeatable
pattern of delivery that we can rely on.

**We limit 'teaching' time**: This means that we have to be clear in the way
we explain the models and concepts, remove any unnecessary detail, and simplify
the material as much as possible (which is harder than it looks!). It also
means we maximise the time for participants to practice and reflect.


Design features
---------------

We've developed this course over hundreds of hours of design, development, and
delivery. We've iterated and improved it based on feedback from participants
and facilitators. We've also drawn on our experience of designing and
delivering other courses, and our understanding of how adults learn. The output
of all that work is a course that is designed to be:

**Accessible and flexible**: We want a wide range of people to enjoy this
course and for it to be useful in different contexts. We've designed it to be
delivered online, in English, and in a modular format. We've also designed it
to be flexible, so that you can adapt it to your own needs, for example by
using different tools, delivering it in another language, or delivering it in a
different way. We encourage you to adapt the course to your own needs, and to
share your experiences with us.

**Interactive and experiential**: Participants can learn by doing, and by
reflecting on what they've done. We've designed it to be delivered in a way
that encourages participants to engage with the material, with each other, and
with the facilitator.

**Consistent and scalable**: Colleagues who do the course at different times
will learn the same things. We've designed it to be scalable, so that it can be
delivered to diverse participants across cultures and contexts.

**Robust and reliable**: It's important to use that the material worls with
diverse participants across cultures and contexts. We've designed it to support
employees with any behaviour change that is needed for better conversations,
and to be relevant and easy to apply in business situations.

**Relevant and easy to apply**: We want the content of the course to be
relevant and easy to apply in business situations. We've designed it to support
employees with any behaviour change that is needed for better conversations,
and to be relevant and easy to apply in business situations.

**Engaging and Actionable**: We strive to be clear, concise and for the skills
to be actionable, so that participants are motivated to use what they've
learned immediately. We know people apply new skills when they are relevant to
their circumstances.

Our Processes
=============


### File: course/index.rst

==========
The Course
==========

`Better Conversations <https://betterconversations.courses>`_ is at its heart, a
course to teach people to have better conversations in everyday contexts using
Clean Language.

The course was initially developed through 15 pilots over 3 years, and through
training contracts with organisations such as government agencies, including
our sister software company, Amphora Research Systems and evolved it so that
any trainer can deliver it effectively straight off the bat.

We now have a network of trainers across the world who have delivered the
course to hundreds of people. We continue to observe and learn from their
experiences and feedback. We have also developed resources to 
support the course, including a handbook, a set of emails to send to attendees
before and after the course, module plans and facilitator guides.

The Foundation provides support to trainers and facilitators to help them
deliver the course. This includes a community of practice, tailored support
with marketing materials and advice on how to deliver the course effectively.
We run our own 'Experience Courses' and peer support sessions to help trainers
develop their skills and confidence. These Experience Courses are designed to
help trainers understand the course from the perspective of an attendee, and to
help them develop their own style of delivery. These are run by experienced
trainers and are a great way to learn from others. We do this to provide a hgih
quality experience for those learning to deliver the course. Our courses are
invite-only as we want to ensure our Partners are able to offer their own
public and bespoke courses on a commercial basis.

The course uses Clean Language principles and practical applications to prime
attendees to achieve better conversations, with peers, family and friends. It’s
been designed for online delivery but works well in person too.

It's a project that has evolved through collaboration, continual innovation and
applied playfulness. Our friends and fellow travellers on this journey are the
main reason we have got this far. And we hope, as you are reading this, you
might decide to join us.

### File: course/70-Versioning.rst

==========
Versioning
==========

-------------------
Why Versions Matter
-------------------

We hope Better Conversations is a simple to deliver and delightful to attend.

One reason for this is that we've done a lot of work to figure out what works
and write it down in great detail. This leads to something that can be
delivered reliably ensuring a quality experience for everyone involved.

We want to keep improving; the course has changed a lot over the years thanks
to the contributions of many people. All those suggestions and observations
really do help make the course better.

However, people are building their business on this and we owe them a
consistent, stable platform to work from. If we just changed stuff randomly it
would cause a lot of anxiety and frustration.

So we're going to be very clear about the versions of the course. This approach
is well proven in other areas and we hope it'll help us both improve and
innovate whilst also allowing others to build on what we've done.

-----------------
Versioning Policy
-----------------

Everything we publish on this site will have a version number in the filename.
This number takes the form X.Y.Z e.g.
 
 - "BCO Master Flight Plan v1.0 Module 1.2.3 docx"
 - "BCO Handbook v1.4.pdf"

The *major* version in this case is version 1. This represents significant
changes to the file. Any file with the same major version number is compatible
with any other. So you could use a v1.2.3 flight plan with a v1.4 handbook.

We'll also make minor improvements to things such as formatting, readability,
diagrams etc. These changes will be released as minor versions where the
*minor* version is the Y in vX.Y.Z.

Some changes might only require small adjustments, for example fixing typos.
There's no need to change the major or minor version for this. These will be
released as a patch where the *patch* version is the Z in vX.Y.Z.

Occasionally we might need to issue a new version not because the course content
has changed but because are working on the flightplan tooling or course 
delivery system. In which case we'll add a letter at the end e.g. v3.0.1a. This
indicates there's no change to the content. You should use the latest version
available and generally we'll withdraw earlier versions of that specific version.

++++++++++++++++++++
Testing new material
++++++++++++++++++++

If you are working with us on testing new material, you may also come across a
*pre-release* version. These will be marked with a -alpha or -beta suffix, e.g.
v1.2.3-alpha. We will not be publishing these versions as they are only for
testing.

++++++++++++
Translations
++++++++++++

We are developing translated versions of the course. These will be marked
with a suffix indicating the language code and country code, e.g. v1.2.3-en-GB
indicates that the file is in English with British spellings, v1.2.3-nl-NL
indicates that the file is in Dutch (nl) as used in The Netherlands (NL).

You don't have to move to the latest versions of things but you might want to.

--------------
Support Policy
--------------

Currently we're on version 3 of Better Conversations.

Our policy is:

 - We will release new major versions every 6 months or so
 - We will support a major version for 12 months after release
 - We will release minor versions as needed

What this means is if you want to stay current with the Foundation's support of
Better Conversations, you will need to update what you do every 6 - 12 months.

.. todo:: 

    Link to the roles here and make sure the role table
    expresses expectations

If you are an Associate, you can do what you want but all the material on this
site, and discussion forums will be focused on the past 2 versions of the
course, e.g. what's happened in the past year.

If you are a Partner we expect you to be delivering the current or last major
version.

We have prepared a handbook for participants which you can download
as a PDF `here </documentation/800-resources/handbook.html>`_ 
It contains information about the course and also the material that's
taught.

We have prepared a set of email templates that you can use to invite
participants and followup after each module `here
</documentation/800-resources/email_templates.html>`_

We recognise that people want to customise the handbook, with their own
branding, contact information, etc. People have also taken individual sections
and e.g. on State and used them in other circumstances like coaching. Please
get in touch if you would like to do this.

About Us
========

The Foundation is a not-for-profit organisation, founded by Simon Coles and Chandima Dutton, to help people have better conversations at work and beyond. We believe that better conversations lead to better relationships, better decisions, and better outcomes. We want to help people to be their unique selves, and to connect with others in a way that is meaningful and fulfilling.

If you want to engage with an entity that is ISO 9001 certified, B-Corp certified, is VAT registered, 
and has a long history then we're happy to work with you through Amphora Solutions Ltd.

The Foundation is a non-profit and is not set up to do business in the same way.

In addition - we're here for our partners. Nothing is more important to us than the relationships we have with our partners.

Amphora Solutions will happily engage with organisations who want Better Conversations at scale. We'll provide 
the reassurance of a long-standing, well-regarded company that has been in business for over 15 years.

We'll rely on our existing partners and faculty to help us deliver the course, and we'll be working with them to

Governance
==========

This is all a bit nerdy, but it's important to be transparent how we are structured and run.
(It is also public information you could find bit a bit of digging, so we're not doing
anything magnificent sharing this, but it's good to be open about it.)

Intellectual Property Policy
----------------------------

As a general rule we release our IP under either a Creative Commons license or an Open Source license 
depending on the nature of the work [#f1]_. We believe that the best way to get our work out there is to make it
available under the most permissive terms possible.

.. [#f1] "Creative Commons" is appropriate for works that are copyrighted but where we want to allow people 
   to use our work under certain conditions. "Open Source" is appropriate for code.

    


### File: about/governance/members.rst

-------
Members
-------

A company limited by guarantee has "members", who are the equivalent of shareholders in a company limited by shares.

You'll notice in the Companies House requirements we have to address this
"It should have a pool of money, or a regular source of income to promote its objects".

Whilst we hope in time to be able to generate some income to support our work, at the moment
we're reliant on the support of Amphora Research Systems Ltd, who have provided the initial
funding to get us started. They are also providing the infrastructure and support for the
Foundation to operate.

So the "Member" of the Foundation is Pithos Ltd, which is the holding company that owns Amphora Research Systems Ltd.
The Foundation can't pay dividends, so any profits it makes will be used to further its objectives.

Note that generally when we talk about "members" we are referring to the members of the Better Conversations community.
It is only in the legal articles that the word "member" is used where you might normally expect "shareholder" in a for-profit company.



### File: about/governance/board.rst

---------
The Board
---------

The Foundation is run by a Board of Directors, who are responsible for the governance of the Foundation. 

- Chandima Dutton, CEO and course owner
- Simon Coles, Chairman and CTO



### File: about/governance/structure.rst

---------
Structure
---------

The Better Conversations Foundation Ltd is a company registered with Companies House
in the UK (company number 15602408). `You can see the registration details here <https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/15602408>`_.

As a "Foundation" it is a company limited by guarantee, which means that it has no shareholders 
and cannot pay dividends - it is a non profit. The `relevant details from companies house are 
here <https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/incorporation-and-names/annex-a-sensitive-words-and-expressions-or-words-that-could-imply-a-connection-with-government#foundation>`_.

  To use this word in your proposed name, the company should normally be limited by guarantee. It should have a pool of money, or a regular source of income to promote its objects. You will need to confirm this when you submit your application.

  A non-profit distribution clause should be included in the articles of association. The non-profit clause provides that any profits are used to further the objects of the company and not paid to the members as dividends.

  In the case of a business name, the articles or relevant governance document should include similar clauses and you should provide a copy when you submit your application.

Articles of Association
=======================

    -----------------------
    Index to the articles
    -----------------------

    A company is governed by its Articles of Association, which are the rules by which the company is run. Our articles
    are just the model articles from Companies House, with the addition of the B-Corp requirements. 

    You can find more information about the B-Corp legal requirements `here <https://bcorporation.uk/b-corp-certification/before-you-certify/legal-requirement/>`_.
    We took the model wording from `this document <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h0iswtPoGeKW3nJqwketYsXBsFKn4aG5/view>`_ for companies limited by guarantee.

    The articles are structured into 5 parts:

      1. `Interpretation and defining the liabilities of members <part1.html>`_
      2. `How the Directors - their role, powers and responsibilities, as well as how they are appointed and meetings are run <part2.html>`_
      3. `Members - how meetings are run and how members can participate <part3.html>`_  (note for our purposes, there's one "Member", our holding company Pithos)
      4. `Various administrative arrangements <part4.html>`_
      5. `The B-Corp requirements for what Directors must consider when making decisions <part5.html>`_

As part of the promotion for the event at the Open University next week
@russ_lewis and @lizmoody kindly arranged for us to have a view recorded by
the OU’s media team. And oh my, what a difference an experienced producer
makes! We spoke for ~20 minutes which they then edited down to this 3
minute video.

You might find this 3 minute video an interesting watch in terms of how we
explain things and also what the OU editors found relevant to have in the
video, of all of the things that we might say about the course and the
Foundation.

If you’re in the area, this event looks like it will be awesome and it is
very reasonably priced too!

You can see the video on Russ Lewis’s `LinkedIn Post <https://www.linkedin.com/posts/russlewis-agile-ways-of-working_opensource-training-leadershipdevelopment-activity-7242908893431963650-PSZ_/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop>`_.

Work with Us
============

We work with a wide range of partners to help us achieve our mission. We are always looking for new partners to work with, and we are open to new ideas and ways of working. 

We want to help people to help their teams, communities and organisations have better conversations. We believe that the best way to do this is to work with others who share our values and purpose.

We'd especially like to hear from you if you are a non-profit, charity or social enterprise, or you work in a community or public sector organisation. We are also interested in working with businesses who share our values and purpose.

### File: work-with-us/course-definition.rst

====================================================
What makes a course the Better Conversations course?
====================================================

----
Aims
----

We encourage people to take what we've done and do their own thing with it; a
reasonable question is "at what point does it become a different course?". This 
is particularly important when people want to call their course "Better Conversations" 
and refer to the Better Conversations Foundation. It also defines who is eligible for
badges and certification as described in the `badges documentation </documentation/badges.html>`_.

If you want to call your course “Better Conversations”, and associate yourself with 
The Foundation, then this is what we need you to do.

Remember that we're not trying to restrict people from doing what they want,
we're trying to set expectations for what we can support. You can do what you 
want with this material subject to the Creative Commons license.

This our current attempt at that balance between celebrating diversity and a 
standadised course we can support. We welcome feedback and suggestions
and will adjust as needed.

----------------------------------------------
What makes it the Better Conversations course?
----------------------------------------------

Before we get into the detail, just to emphasise the point, we're not trying to
restrict people from doing what they want. We're trying to set expectations for
what we can support.

If you want to call your course "Better Conversations", and associate yourself
with us, then this is what we need you to do.

Precision matters in these things, so the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this are to be
interpreted as described in RFC 2119 which we've referenced below.

- Everyone facilitating the course MUST have completed the full course themselves with
  the Foundation, or one of our Ambassadors. It is RECOMMENDED they have also
  attended an Experience Course as an Observer and they MUST have observed the specific
  module that they are facilitating.

- You MUST follow a flight plan. This is the core of the course and the
  foundation of everything we do. It's what we can support, along with the Handbook.

- You MUST follow flight plans which are of the same major version as the current
  course as provided by the Foundation. At the time of writing this is version 3, 
  the latest version is 3.0.4 which means you can use any version from 3.0.0 to 3.0.4.

- You MUST keep modules 1-5 intact, in the same order, with the same names. Module
  6 is optional and if you include it, you SHOULD customise it to your
  context.

- You MUST use the same models and exercises.

- You MAY NOT substitute any of the models with your own.

- You MAY add additional modules, either at the start or end of your course.

- You SHOULD deliver the course as a series of 1-hour sessions spaced a week apart.
  Our experience is that you will maximise the impact of the course because the
  week between sessions allows people to apply the skills to their own situation
  and reflect on what they've learned.
  
- You SHOULD use your own words in the content of the modules, but you MUST be
  aiming for the same outcomes as the original course. We know that effective
  training means you need to use your own voice.

- You MUST NOT record the sessions. 

  - Better Conversations is an experiential course and we want to encourage people
    to experience it for themselves, whilst also protecting participants' privacy.

  - If people miss a session, they are welcome to attend that module with the
    Foundation if they are unable to catch up with you, but you MUST NOT record
    sessions under any circumstances.

- You MAY deliver the course in person. Whilst it is designed to be delivered
  remotely, we recognise that there are contexts where in-person delivery is
  preferable or necessary. Engaging in `our community <https://community.betterconversations.foundation/>`_ 
  will help you adapt the course for your own circumstances.

==============
Service Levels
==============

Everything on this site is free. We ask you to respect that and the collective
effort that goes into making this material available. If you feel moved to help
others as we help you, that would be lovely - we want this to spread as far and
wide as possible.

What that means is either individuals are giving of their time freely or
they're being paid by our sponsors to help you for free. People who work for
our sponsors have a "day job" and whilst they have a percentage of their time
allocated to the Foundation, their "day job" takes priority because that's what
pays the bills.

The service level we're committing to is "best efforts". If you need more we're
happy to engage with you on a commercial basis. We can do proper
Enterprise-level support contracts if people are interested.

Generally it all works out fine because you don't need our active attention to
use this work. Sometimes people get grumpy because we're all supportive and
they slip into thinking they're a customer and we're a supplier who have
committed to a certain level of service. This is a misunderstanding of the
situation. Please don't take us for granted just because we're nicer and more
generous than most.

Yes, this has happened - but we're ok with it, we're just learning how to set
expectations better. Also we're not naming names, but we'd rather be this side
of the fence than taking advantage of our "customers" without actually offering
any way for them to make an income.

----------
Complaints
----------

Sometimes things go wrong. Sometimes you might get frustrated. Please bring
that up directly with Simon or Chandima. Raising things in a public forum makes
everything so much more complicated, especially if there's misunderstandings.
And generally most things are misunderstandings, so a quiet word is better than
a public drama-filled rant.

We've worked really hard on this, not only developing it but then documenting
it in a way that others can build on. On a human level it's always nice to hear
from people how they've used our work. You can send us fan mail and feedback
here.

Improvements and Suggestions
============================


It is inevitable on a project this size that there are "bugs" in the
content. If you spot one, we'd be grateful if you'd let us know.

Sometimes you might look at something and think "That could be better". 
We're really happy to hear those suggestions and have a conversation with
you. That will likely lead to:

- A clear improvement which we quickly incorporate into the course
- A more involved change which might need more time and thought
- Us explaining why things are why they are and the tradeoffs involved

That doesn't mean you can't customise what you deliver as you'd like, 
we very much encourage people to take this and make it their own. But
we do have to be very thoughtful what's in the "Main" version of 
Better Conversations which everyone else builds off. 

Note that the Foundation needs to be the copyright holder of anything
incorporated into the Better Conversations repository. Which generally
isn't a problem but we can't accept material taken from elsewhere 
without a copyright assignment. Our ability to give this stuff away
and for you to trust we have the rights to do so is crucial to the 
success of the whole project.

A Note About Branding
---------------------

If you want to use our work in a commercial context, and would prefer to
use your own branding, that is within the terms of the license and we'd 
encourage you to do so. This especially applies to the use of the course
content internally in a company or organisation. Please do put your logo
on it. Just make sure you retain somewhere a reference to the Foundation
and the CC-BY-SA-4.0 license - even if it is in small text at the bottom.

If you take this and build something new, we'd love to hear about it. 
Please don't call it "Better Conversations" as it'll confuse people.

<!-- TO DO

- Update for this:

I Know What You Are Thinking Stories - A dedicated FAQ or “Common Questions” page could be added to the website to address common concerns or objections that people may have about the foundation’s work. This could include information about how the foundation operates, where funding comes from, or how individuals or organizations can get involved.

-->

<!--summary: This is a summary of what this page contains -->


We’ve tried to answer a few of the most common questions here, however we do actively encourage you to sign into our far more detailed documentation platform and explore further. You’ll find a more detailed FAQs section there too.

---

# How will you help me deliver the course?
We provide flight plans, which are design-and-delivery documents containing everything that a trainer and technical producer will need for a tightly planned one hour. We also supply professionally produced course documentation and an app that gathers feedback and issues participant certificates.

# Can you help me get people onto the course?
We will help you with ideas to promote your course and how to expand your marketing reach should you choose to. We’ll also actively promote your courses using our own marketing engine and offer 1:1 telephone support on sales and marketing to help you with larger tenders and corporate opportunities.

# What other support will I get?
All trainers delivering Better Conversations are granted membership to our free community, where you can talk to our team and other trainers, sharing your experiences, learning and contributing to the evolution of Better Conversations. We’re all in this together.

# Can I change things about the course?
Absolutely! If you spot a better way to do something, either overall, for your market, or in a specific situation, we actively encourage you to enhance what we give you. Our only request is that you let us and the wider Better Conversations community know, so we can all learn from each other, and your improvements can be added to subsequent versions of the course.

# What will it cost me to offer the Better Conversations course?
We are well funded, so trainers can join us and deliver the course fully supported for free for a full year. After that time, the only fee is a small percentage of the course fees earned. So, if you’re not making money from the course, you don’t owe us anything.

We’re not here to make loads of money (although it’s totally fine with us if you do). All we want is for Better Conversations to spread through the world and be of benefit to our relationships with other people.

---
If you’ve read these FAQs, explored the documentation, and you still have questions or would like to talk to a team member, we’d love to hear from you. Just drop us a line.

### File: documentation/badges.md

# LinkedIn Certifications/Badges

The Foundation is able to issue badges to participants who have completed the course.

You can see an example on [Chandima's LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chandimadutton/) which looks like this:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/_static/images/chandima-certifications.png" alt="Chandima's LinkedIn Badges">
</p>

## Badges we issue

Currently we issue two badges:

- Better Conversations Attendee 
- Better Conversations Faculty

The Attendee badge is issued to participants who have completed the course with the Foundation or an approved partner.

The Faculty badge is issued to facilitators who have completed the course with the Foundation and have delivered
the course to an acceptable standard on behalf of the Foundation in the past 6 months. 

## Who can issue badges

Attendee badges can be issued by:

- The Foundation
- Foundation Faculty approved by the Foundation
- Faculty members of government-recognised or accredited institutions, as approved by the Foundation

Note that the Foundation reserves the right to withdraw approval for any of the above at any time.

Whilst we don't mind what you call your course, you must give "Better Conversations" as defined 
[here](/work-with-us/course-definition) which 
includes following the flight plans, and delivering at least modules 1-5.


## Badge Issuance

We have automated the issuance of badges to attendees and facilitators. If you are an approved issuer, you can issue badges via the Badge Issuance System in the coordinator. You will get a URL which you can share with participants:

- They will be asked to confirm that they have completed the course
- They will be asked to complete a brief survey
- They will be asked to provide their name and email address (preferably the same as their LinkedIn profile)
- And finally they agree to the terms of use (which is basically they give us their permission to issue the badge)


The proposer will then get a confirmation email, once they've confirmed they've attended the course, we'll issue the badge. They will then get an email from Open Badge Factory with instrucctions on how to claim their badge.


## PDF Certificates

We use [Open Badge Factory](https://openbadgefactory.com/en/) to issue the badges, and they also 
offer a PDF download for people who would like to print their badge and frame it.

### File: documentation/assumptions.md

# Assumptions

We are assuming that you are familiar with the course and have been on it yourself. If you haven't, we recommend that you do so before you start using these materials. 

You don't need to be a professional facilitator to use these materials, but you do need to be comfortable with the idea of facilitating a group of people. You don't need to be a technical whizz either, but you do need to be comfortable using a computer and the internet, software like Zoom and Microsoft Word.

Finally, we've described the course as we have developed and delivered it. For example, we use Zoom for the online sessions, and we use Microsoft Word for the course materials. You might want to use different tools, and that's fine. We've tried to make the materials as flexible as we can, so you can adapt them to your own needs. We usually deliver the course in English, but you might want to deliver it in another language. Again, that's fine. We've tried to explain things in a way that's easy to translate. We usually deliver the course over five 1-hour online modules (with an optional 6th module) across several weeks, but you might want to deliver it in a different way.

# 2  **Assumptions** – what are you making up?

> "Between stimulus and response, there is a space. In that space lies our freedom and our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our happiness."
>
> — Victor E. Frankl, as quoted by Stephen Covey

When we are conversing with someone, it is possible to describe what is happening to us in three steps: I see and hear what the other person is saying or doing, I will think and feel something based on that, and then I say and/or do something in response. 

% TODO: Image is not centered
<img src="/_static/images/my_context.png" alt="Hello" style="image-center" width = "50%">

This model can be described as a stimulus-response model. Whilst there is much more complexity in the way our brain and our body processes information[^3] , this simple model can help us consider what happens in a conversation. The state model we considered in the previous section forms the middle step of this stimulus-response model.

Next, we will use this model to understand what happens in each step so we can improve our conversational skills. 

## 2.1	What we see and hear

Typically, we use sight and sound to have a conversation. We can think of this as data into our system. Someone observing the situation might notice the same sights and sounds, if they are noticing and paying attention to the same things that we are. Misunderstandings and conflict can arise when each person is noticing or paying attention to different things, or one person has information the other person doesn’t have. Of course, we are not restricted to sight and sound — any of our senses (including taste, smell and touch) can provide us with evidence about the outside world. Sight and sound are the usual senses we use in a conversation with someone else.

One way to understand what you are paying attention to is to reflect on this question: 

- **What am I seeing or hearing here?**

## 2.2	What we think and feel

We can process what is going on around us rapidly and respond instinctively before we even realise what has happened. This is a skill we have evolved to support our survival as individuals and as a species. We aren’t fully aware of how our thoughts and feelings drive our responses – much of this processing occurs outside of consciousness. Sometimes the instinctive or habitual reaction is not the most helpful response – for us or for the other person.

What we think and feel is constantly updated in the mental models we hold to survive and interact with the world. We automatically use past experience to work out what the next action should be. However, we have also evolved the ability to check our actions and override those automatic reactions. It is possible to retrain ourselves to learn new skills and ways of responding[^4] .

% Maybe add footnotes to indiviual bullet points
Our thoughts and feelings are influenced by[^5][^6]:

-	What we notice and pay attention to – what ‘data’ we select from our senses about the external world and internally, from our bodies;
-	Our way of making meaning of things including how we perceive the situation, the language we use, and how we rephrase what others say into our own words;
-	The assumptions we make about ourselves, others, or the situation based on the meaning we have given to what we are noticing; and
-	Our reasoning, including how we perceive cause and effect, the stories we construct,  how make judgements and how we decide on action. 

Our brain processes the data that our five senses pick up. It is also constantly receiving data from our bodies that tells us our physiological state. For example, feeling hungry or tired, or in pain can affect how we think and feel about things. We are only conscious of our feelings when we put our attention on them. We perceive things in a way that makes sense to us, given our past experiences, what we think is important. These assumptions and beliefs can be difficult to let go of.

The physiological data from your body takes time to reach your brain. This why our emotions can persist and still be strongly felt, even though the situation may have changed. It can take time for emotions to ‘settle’.

% TODO: Image is not centered
<img src="/_static/images/think_feel_context.png" alt="Hello" style="image-center" width = "50%">

When we are in conversation, you might find you experience a change in your state during and/or after the after the conversation. A new thought or feeling can emerge and you find you switch from green to red, say. Sometimes the impact is to change the intensity of your state – you might feel more or less happy, for example. 

We can understand more about what is happening in this internal step by asking ourselves: 

- **What am I feeling right now? What impact is this having on me?**
- **What am I assuming here? What do I think is true?**
- **What is the meaning I am making here?**
- **What reasoning follows from this?**

We will cover some more ways of understanding what’s happening in the next section, when we look at context. We advise you not to ask your conversational partner questions like these, as it may come across as critical or aggressive, depending on the context. Remember, the skill here is understanding what’s going on for you.

## 2.3	What we say and do 

The last step in this sequence is behavioural. After rapid internal processing, we decide to say and/or do (or not say/do) something. This is our external reaction or response and can be observed by someone else.

### File: course/handbook/state.md

# 1. **State** - how do your thoughts and feelings affect your conversations?

State underpins our conversations. When we refer to state, we mean the thoughts and feelings that are always present in the mind and are interdependent. They cannot be separated. Feelings include sensations from the body, emotions and mood.

We use a Traffic Light Model to describe how your mental, emotional and biological processes affect you. We’ve inverted the traffic lights to indicate deliberate thinking and reasoning happen at the uppermost level (green). No state is ‘better’ than another state, although some states are more helpful to us in the situations we encounter in modern life.


## 1.1 <span style="color:red"> RED state – stop, and take a break</span>

In the red state, your motivations will be to avoid harm (including perceived threats from others), avoid loss, seek safety, and secure the resources that keep you alive (like food and water) and able to reproduce. This is a basic survival instinct in all of us [^1].

You will be feeling unsafe (physically or psychologically) or under attack. Emotions like fear, anger, disgust and sadness are heightened and can feel overwhelming.

Your body’s internal monitoring systems might be signalling you need rest, need food, need water, or are in pain. You might feel suddenly hot or cold, your heart beating rapidly, your breathing becoming shallow.

You might want to fight, flee or freeze in response to these feelings. You can think of a red state as your body’s way of alerting you to something that needs your attention and preparing to tackle it. When under extreme threat, you might be hyper-vigilant. It is also possible your conscious brain shuts down and you faint. Where red state recurs repeatedly and you are trapped, this might lead to feeling helpless, numb, disengaged and lacking the will to seek the resources you need.

You are not well resourced for conversation when you know you are in a red state (or heading towards red). 

## 1.2 <span style = "color:orange"> AMBER/YELLOW state – proceed with caution </span>

In the amber or yellow state, you are motivated to seek social safeness by forming bonds with others who are helpful and supportive. Lack of social safeness means you are not able to give/receive care and protection, aren’t feeling of value to others, or feel unattractive to others[^2]. 

Here you might be feeling a bit disrupted, unsure and have a sense of “not ok-ness” in your system. You might feel uncomfortable in a group or need to demonstrate your social status. Some of your needs are not being met. You may withdraw and not say much, or you may overcompensate and talk a lot! Your competitive streak might show.

Amber state is mainly about your relationship with others, your social status and how you connect and empathise with others. It is very much about your psychological and emotional safety. Here you can still think and ask questions, though your questions may be more self-oriented and cautious.

Conversations happening from amber state can go either way depending on whether you perceive safeness (green state) or perceive a lack of safety, in which case you might find yourself more in the red state.

## 1.3 <span style = "color:green"> GREEN state – good to go </span>

In green state, you are feeling good and connected with yourself, others and are engaged with the environment you are in. All your needs are being met. In this state you can access the best learning and problem-solving parts of your brain.

Here, you might feel curious and creative, be able to think and communicate clearly and feel engaged. You will be taking responsibility for your own actions, showing compassion towards yourself and others, and collaborating well.

This is a highly resourced state in which to have conversations.

Our emotions (e.g. anger, sadness, joy) are ways we encode physiological data from our body. Each of us feels these emotions differently. We may have different feelings to someone else, even though we are experiencing the same situation. Research shows there are cultural differences in emotional experience and the labels we give emotions. 

Our emotions affect where we place our attention. Strong and unpleasant emotions lead to different reactions than pleasant emotions. We are motivated to behave differently, in different states. Learning what happens for us in different emotional states is important in matching our behaviour to the situation.

[^1]: Red is analogous to an activated threat system as described in Gilbert and Simos, Compassion Focused Therapy.

[^2]: Analogous to an underactive soothing system. For a fuller discussion see Gilbert and Simos.

# Introduction

## What to expect

This course comes to you from a dedicated team of trainers and facilitators who have your best interests at heart: to learn and experience the power of better connections at work and home through Better Conversations. We want to make sure the sessions you experience with us are of a high calibre. 

Here’s some things to expect:


-	Clear and easy to understand content.
-	No slides! We will be using flip charts to capture and support your learning  we have learnt that this creates better engagement and allows us to adjust the sessions to your needs. This Course Handbook is designed to help you revise the content and capture your learnings.
-	A sequence of models and exercises that will build on one another, so that by the end, you’ll have new skills and awareness of how to have Better Conversations.
-	Exercises that allow you to learn and practice both as a whole group and in smaller groups (in breakout rooms).
-	Time for reflection on your learning at the end of each session.
-	Fieldwork based on real experiences between sessions to explore and practice the skills. 
-	We may record for our course development purposes; we will always check the group give consent to do this. Discussion in breakout rooms remain private and are not recorded.

## What’s expected of you

This course has been developed to support experiential learning. We keep the theory light–touch and focus on practising skills and reflecting on your experiences. We invite you to:

-	Participate and share some of your own experiences related to the course content; we trust that you will share only what you are comfortable sharing.
-	Be seen and heard during each module, like you would in a room-based course.
-	Respect each other’s experiences and the need for confidential and safe discussions.
-	Keep what you share relevant and of an appropriate amount of information for the exercises we will be using to train the skills.
-	Ask questions if you don’t understand.
-	Let us know if you have any time constraints or other needs that might affect your ability to participate and learn

## Zoom orientation

-	If you are unable to download the Zoom app to your computer, you can use Zoom through a web browser.
-	Check your audio and video setup 10–15 minutes before the call. Zoom lets you join a test meeting to check this before you need to join a meeting. We advise you use headphones and find a quiet place to join the call from.
-	Familiarise yourself with the Zoom controls as they appear on your device. 
-	Mute yourself when not speaking. We might mute you when we’re training the models or listening to another participant if we think that there may be some background noise through your audio.
-	Pin the Zoom window for the facilitator if it is helpful.
-	Try the Gallery and Speaker views – see what view you like the best.
-	Try the Chat function – we will sometimes use this to collect information from everyone. You can also use it ask questions or share insights.
-	Turn on Captions to allow you to see live captions and a live transcript of the session

More information can be found on the Zoom support pages [here](https://support.zoom.us/)

## Safe practice and confidentiality

We've found that sometimes people can be very enthusiastic in the use of the tools we cover. At this introductory stage, we'd like to gently caution you about how you communicate these tools to others. Better Conversations can happen just with the shift in noticing, so start there. 
We'll give you straightforward but powerful concepts and models which will help you have Better Conversations. As you develop new skills using the models and approaches, it is important not to impose your new skills, questions and listening skills on your conversational partners in a way that is too far from what they are used to. We’ll teach you ways to practice these skills with a light touch.
We ask that you keep what you see and hear in this within the group you are working with. People may share some personal stories and information and we’d like to maintain a safe and trusting environment in which they can engage with the material and each other.

## Intended learning outcomes

We have designed this course to:

-	Increase your awareness of your own state and how affects your conversations
-	Support you to notice and get curious about your conversational partner’s state
-	Develop your listening and questioning skills
-	Build on your existing conversational approaches and experiences
-	Determine your own outcomes for Better Conversations and how to achieve them

We’d be delighted to talk to you after the course is completed to understand how and if these have been met.

## We’d be delighted to talk to you after the course is completed to understand how and if these have been met.

1. **State** – how do your thoughts and feelings affect your conversations?

2. **Assumptions** – what are you making up when you are in a conversation?

3. **Context** – how do you make sense of it all?

4. **Listening with Curiosity** – how can you influence a conversation?

5. **Intentional Conversations** – how can you have a purposeful conversation?

Each  session follows a similar format:

-	Welcome
-	Time for questions
-	Check in
-	Connecting to previous learning and experience
-	Introducing the topic and model
-	Group exploration and practice in the whole group and in pairs/threes
-	Reflections on the learning in the session
-	Suggested fieldwork and close

We invite you to stay for a few minutes after the session closes to share any further insights or ask us questions (the Afterparty).

## Support between sessions

Please use contact us at help@betterconversations.foundation if you have any questions or need support

## Your learning outcomes

We invite you to consider your learning outcome(s) in Module 1 by reflecting on the following question:

**What kind of conversations would you like to be better after this course?**

We want to enable people to have better conversations, better relationships and better outcomes. We will do this by bringing the power of Clean Language into organisations, on a global scale.

We have a disruptive model for how we like to work with people to achieve our aims. It's about enabling others, growing organically and challenging norms.

We bring our capabilities, skills and experience and encourage you to bring yours. And we achieve more together that way than we can possibly do alone.

# Our Story

This is the story of how the course was developed, and how the Foundation came to be.

<!-- ```{todo}

Rewrite origin story - Simon to check these points are accurate
- Simon's early career in a software company where he met Caitlin Walker through a training course
- The approach later came to be known as Metaphors at Work; link to Open Uni course
- Simon and Allison bought out his part of the company and started Amphora Research Systems
- Simon realised he was using Clean Language very naturally in his sales conversations
- He engaged Caitlin [and Nancy Doyle?] to run some trainings in Clean Language; these were in person and involved the whole team
- [Simon realised that Clean Language was also useful for understanding neurodiversity; although some aspects of Clean Language were difficult for some people, the overall effect was positive]
- Simon wanted Clean Language not just in the sales team but throughout the whole business
- He couldn't find a training course that matched what his business needed
- Simon wondered: "If we want more Clean Language in an organisation, how do we do that? And what happens when you bring someone new into the company, when everyone else has had Clean Language training?"
- Another issue was being able to train people in Clean Language in a way that was accessible and repeatable, for example part-time employees who had caring responsibilities that meant they couldn't attend a full-day training or travel far from home
- Simon tried to various approaches including recording short videos explaining the approach, but these didn't work. He realised that he needed a course that was interactive and involved practicing the skills, not watching videos.
- He came up with some criteria for the course he needed:
    - It had to be accessible and repeatable
    - It had to be online
    - It had to be modular, and fit into people's working day - an hour at a time
    - It had to be consistent, so that colleagues who did the course at different times would learn the same things
    - It had to be run over a realtively short timescale - the original course was 4 modules over 4 weeks
    - It had to be scalable
    - It had to be robust and reliable when delivered to diverse participants across cultures and contexts
    - It had to support employees with any behaviour change that is needed for better conversations, and be relevant and easy to apply in business situations

- The first version of the course was run in 2019, and has been iteratively developed since then.

# Part 2: Directors

## Directors' Powers and Responsibilities

### 3. Directors’ general authority

Subject to the articles, the directors are responsible for the management of the company’s business, for which purpose they may exercise all the powers of the company.

### 4. Members’ reserve power

(1) The members may, by special resolution, direct the directors to take, or refrain from taking, specified action.

(2) No such special resolution invalidates anything which the directors have done before the passing of the resolution

### 5. Directors may delegate 

(1) Subject to the articles, the directors may delegate any of the powers which are conferred on them under the articles:

1. to such person or committee
2. by such means (including by power of attorney)
3. to such an extent
4. in relation to such matters or territories
5. on such terms and conditions as they think fit.

(2) If the directors so specify, any such delegation may authorise further delegation of the directors’ powers by any person to whom they are delegated.

(3) The directors may revoke any delegation in whole or part, or alter its terms and conditions.

### 6. Committees 

(1) Committees to which the directors delegate any of their powers must follow procedures which are based as far as they are applicable on those provisions of the articles which govern the taking of decisions by directors.

(2) The directors may make rules of procedure for all or any committees, which prevail over rules derived from the articles if they are not consistent with them.

## Decision-making By Directors

### 7. Directors to take decisions collectively 

(1) The general rule about decision-making by directors is that any decision of the directors must be either a majority decision at a meeting or a decision taken in accordance with article 8.

(2) If:

1. the company only has one director, and

2. no provision of the articles requires it to have more than one director, the general rule does not apply, and the director may take decisions without regard to any of the provisions of the articles relating to directors’ decision-making.

### 8. Unanimous decisions

(1) A decision of the directors is taken in accordance with this article when all eligible directors indicate to each other by any means that they share a common view on a matter.

(2) Such a decision may take the form of a resolution in writing, copies of which have been signed by each eligible director or to which each eligible director has otherwise indicated agreement in writing.

(3) References in this article to eligible directors are to directors who would have been entitled to vote on the matter had it been proposed as a resolution at a directors’ meeting.

(4) A decision may not be taken in accordance with this article if the eligible directors would not have formed a quorum at such a meeting.

### 9. Calling a directors’ meeting 

(1) Any director may call a directors’ meeting by giving notice of the meeting to the directors or by authorising the company secretary (if any) to give such notice.

(2) Notice of any directors’ meeting must indicate:

1. its proposed date and time

2. where it is to take place

3. if it is anticipated that directors participating in the meeting will not be in the same place, how it is proposed that they should communicate with each other during the meeting.

(3) Notice of a directors’ meeting must be given to each director, but need not be in writing

(4) Notice of a directors’ meeting need not be given to directors who waive their entitlement to notice of that meeting, by giving notice to that effect to the company not more than 7 days after the date on which the meeting is held. Where such notice is given after the meeting has been held, that does not affect the validity of the meeting, or of any business conducted at it.

### 10. Participation in directors’ meetings 

(1) Subject to the articles, directors participate in a directors’ meeting, or part of a directors’ meeting, when:

1. the meeting has been called and takes place in accordance with the articles

2. they can each communicate to the others any information or opinions they have on any particular item of the business of the meeting

(2) In determining whether directors are participating in a directors’ meeting, it is irrelevant where any director is or how they communicate with each other.

(3) If all the directors participating in a meeting are not in the same place, they may decide that the meeting is to be treated as taking place wherever any of them is.

### 11. Quorum for directors’ meetings 

(1) At a directors’ meeting, unless a quorum is participating, no proposal is to be voted on, except a proposal to call another meeting.

(2) The quorum for directors’ meetings may be fixed from time to time by a decision of the directors, but it must never be less than two, and unless otherwise fixed it is two.

(3) If the total number of directors for the time being is less than the quorum required, the directors must not take any decision other than a decision—
    
1. to appoint further directors, or
2. to call a general meeting so as to enable the members to appoint further directors.

### 12. Chairing of directors’ meetings 

(1) The directors may appoint a director to chair their meetings.

(2) The person so appointed for the time being is known as the chairman.

(3) The directors may terminate the chairman’s appointment at any time.

(4) If the chairman is not participating in a directors’ meeting within ten minutes of the time at which it was to start, the participating directors must appoint one of themselves to chair it.

### 13. Casting vote 

(1) If the numbers of votes for and against a proposal are equal, the chairman or other director chairing the meeting has a casting vote.

(2) But this does not apply if, in accordance with the articles, the chairman or other director is not to be counted as participating in the decision-making process for quorum or voting purposes.

### 14. Conflicts of interest 

(1) If a proposed decision of the directors is concerned with an actual or proposed transaction or arrangement with the company in which a director is interested, that director is not to be counted as participating in the decision-making process for quorum or voting purposes.

(2) But if paragraph (3) applies, a director who is interested in an actual or proposed transaction or arrangement with the company is to be counted as participating in the decision-making process for quorum and voting purposes.

(3) This paragraph applies when:

1. the company by ordinary resolution disapplies the provision of the articles which would otherwise prevent a director from being counted as participating in the decision-making process;

2. the director’s interest cannot reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict of interest; or

3. the director’s conflict of interest arises from a permitted cause.

4. For the purposes of this article, the following are permitted causes:
  
      1. a guarantee given, or to be given, by or to a director in respect of an obligation incurred by or on behalf of the company or any of its subsidiaries;
      
      2. subscription, or an agreement to subscribe, for securities of the company or any of its subsidiaries, or to underwrite, sub-underwrite, or guarantee subscription for any such securities; and 
      
      3. arrangements pursuant to which benefits are made available to employees and directors or former employees and directors of the company or any of its subsidiaries which do not provide special benefits for directors or former directors.
  
5. For the purposes of this article, references to proposed decisions and decision-making processes include any directors’ meeting or part of a directors’ meeting.

6. Subject to paragraph (7), if a question arises at a meeting of directors or of a committee of directors as to the right of a director to participate in the meeting (or part of the meeting) for voting or quorum purposes, the question may, before the conclusion of the meeting, be referred to the chairman whose ruling in relation to any director other than the chairman is to be final and conclusive.

7. If any question as to the right to participate in the meeting (or part of the meeting) should arise in respect of the chairman, the question is to be decided by a decision of the directors at that meeting, for which purpose the chairman is not to be counted as participating in the meeting (or that part of the meeting) for voting or quorum purposes.

### 15. Records of decisions to be kept 

The directors must ensure that the company keeps a record, in writing, for at least 10 years from the date of the decision recorded, of every unanimous or majority decision taken by the directors.

### 16. Directors’ discretion to make further rules 

Subject to the articles, the directors may make any rule which they think fit about how they take decisions, and about how such rules are to be recorded or communicated to directors.

## Appointment of directors

### 17. Methods of appointing directors 

(1) Any person who is willing to act as a director, and is permitted by law to do so, may be appointed to be a director—

1. by ordinary resolution, or
  
2. by a decision of the directors.

(2) In any case where, as a result of death, the company has no members and no directors, the personal representatives of the last member to have died have the right, by notice in writing, to appoint a person to be a director.

(3) For the purposes of paragraph (2), where 2 or more members die in circumstances rendering it uncertain who was the last to die, a younger member is deemed to have survived an older member.

### 18. Termination of director’s appointment 

A person ceases to be a director as soon as
      
1. that person ceases to be a director by virtue of any provision of the Companies Act 2006 or is prohibited from being a director by law;

2. a bankruptcy order is made against that person;

3. a composition is made with that person’s creditors generally in satisfaction of that person’s debts;

4. a registered medical practitioner who is treating that person gives a written opinion to the company stating that that person has become physically or mentally incapable of acting as a director and may remain so for more than three months;

5. notification is received by the company from the director that the director is resigning from office, and such resignation has taken effect in accordance with its terms.

### 19. Directors’ remuneration 

(1) Directors may undertake any services for the company that the directors decide.

(2) Directors are entitled to such remuneration as the directors determine—

1. for their services to the company as directors, and

2.  for any other service which they undertake for the company.

(3) Subject to the articles, a director’s remuneration may—

1. take any form, and

2. include any arrangements in connection with the payment of a pension, allowance or gratuity, or any death, sickness or disability benefits, to or in respect of that director.

(4) Unless the directors decide otherwise, directors’ remuneration accrues from day to day.

(5) Unless the directors decide otherwise, directors are not accountable to the company for any remuneration which they receive as directors or other officers or employees of the company’s subsidiaries or of any other body corporate in which the company is interested.

### 20. Directors’ expenses 

The company may pay any reasonable expenses which the directors properly incur in
connection with their attendance at—

### 30. Poll votes

(1) A poll on a resolution may be demanded—

3. is signed by or on behalf of the member appointing the proxy, or is authenticated in such manner as the directors may determine; and

(3) Proxy notices may specify how the proxy appointed under them is to vote (or that the proxy is to abstain from voting) on one or more resolutions.

(4) Unless a proxy notice indicates otherwise, it must be treated as—

1. allowing the person appointed under it as a proxy discretion as to how to vote on any ancillary or procedural resolutions put to the meeting, and

2. appointing that person as a proxy in relation to any adjournment of the general meeting to which it relates as well as the meeting itself.

### 32. Delivery of proxy notices

(1) A person who is entitled to attend, speak or vote (either on a show of hands or on a poll) at a general meeting remains so entitled in respect of that meeting or any adjournment of it, even though a valid proxy notice has been delivered to the company by or on behalf of that person.

(2) An appointment under a proxy notice may be revoked by delivering to the company a notice in writing given by or on behalf of the person by whom or on whose behalf the proxy notice was given.

(3) A notice revoking a proxy appointment only takes effect if it is delivered before the start of the meeting or adjourned meeting to which it relates.

2. the proposed amendment does not, in the reasonable opinion of the chairman of the meeting, materially alter the scope of the resolution.

(2) A special resolution to be proposed at a general meeting may be amended by ordinary resolution, if—

1. the chairman of the meeting proposes the amendment at the general meeting at which the resolution is to be proposed, and

2. the amendment does not go beyond what is necessary to correct a grammatical or other non-substantive error in the resolution.

(3) If the chairman of the meeting, acting in good faith, wrongly decides that an amendment to a resolution is out of order, the chairman’s error does not invalidate the vote on that resolution.

# What links Bulls and Better Conversations?

We’ve been working on Better Conversations for a while now. We've iterated and improved the course and learned a lot along the way. We’ve had to make some tough decisions about what to include and what to leave out, which we are often asked about. This article is an attempt to explain our thinking by framing it in the context of Picasso’s Bull Series[^Picasso].

[^Picasso]: Revised from an original post on the Better Conversations [community](https://community.betterconversations.foundation/t/what-links-bulls-and-better-conversations/516) on 6 February 2024.

## Picasso’s Bull series and the creative process

In this work, Picasso was experimenting with new media and taking an unconventional approach. He created a series of prints that show progression towards the essence of a bull. Over a period of time he found a representation that was enough to evoke the idea of a bull with just 12 lines[^artsy].

[^artsy]: See [Picasso's Drawings of Bulls](https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-picassos-drawings-bulls-inspired-apples-famously-simple-designs) on Artsy.

It’s a wonderful insight into the creative process. First, the representation gets more complicated as more ideas/features are added. Then it is stripped down, deliberately focused on what matters in this context.

What is left is enough. Focusing attention on the simplest elements helps us come to terms with complexity.

## So what’s this got to do with Better Conversations?

The approaches that inspired earlier versions of the Better Conversations course come from the field of Clean Language[^wiki] (also referred to as ‘Clean’). David Grove developed Clean as part of his psychotherapeutic practice over many years and collaborations.

[^wiki]: See [Clean Language on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Language)

David’s original work was extended by others through developments like Symbolic Modelling and Systemic Modelling. We can work with Clean in specialised modalities in coaching and therapy. The picture has lots of features and detail, like those in the middle of Picasso’s series. And in such circumstances that’s what’s needed: attention to these details.

David continued to innovate his approach[^Wilson], exploring the spatial organisation of information in client’s minds, using more scripted processes to enable that[^Campbell]. He called this field Emergent Knowledge (EK). For me, this is similar to the progression of Picasso’s images of the bull. The space and relationship *between* the lines are as important as the lines themselves.

[^Wilson]: See [The Work and Life of David Grove*, Carol Wilson, Chapter 1](https://www.troubador.co.uk/bookshop/health-wellbeing/the-work-and-life-of-david-grove)
[^Campbell]: See [Panning for Your Client's Gold*, Gina Campbell, p13.](https://www.balboapress.com/en-gb/bookstore/bookdetails/703789-panning-for-your-clients-gold)

Most Clean-based trainings often focus on teaching depth, for use in coaching and therapy. It can take many years to master. Whilst some people have the time and resources to master Clean and EK, others don’t. And they may not need to, for what they would like to do. There’s a desire to be able to apply these skills in new settings, for example from within a team or organisation, minimising external interventions. That’s been the case in our own experience and from talking to other people. It's what motivated us to create Better Conversations.

A consequence of this is that we have had to put aside some things and refine some concepts, models and details to make it make sense in everyday applications. And that has now set us on a different pathway from the original implementations of Clean Language and Emergent Knowledge.

## Why did we make these choices? 

The short answer is that we tried these concepts and models, and they were less effective than we hoped they’d be, for a work context and for the people we serve. We’ve replaced them with simpler concepts and models that work with what we are placing attention on, and that are just enough to help frame the topics we explore.

After years of research, testing, and implementing feedback, we now have a framework that allows people to use Clean Language informally, without needing formal contracts as in a coaching or therapeutic relationship. 

For example, we’ve considered carefully how we introduce Clean Language to people, and decided not to cover the question that elicits metaphor (“…that’s like what?”). This question requires advanced trainings and framing in a professional coaching and therapeutic context. We’ve also moved away from Systemic Modelling as some of the underlying models are problematic in a work context and lack robust research.

## What’s the impact of these choices?

By refining and simplifying our approach, we enable people to improve their conversations using Clean Language, Emergent Knowledge, and other effective communication techniques in just a few days, instead of years. Our framework distills some core principles of these methods, making them accessible and practical for a broad audience.

We believe these skills are valuable and want to share the work we have done widely. Our course materials are freely available under Creative Commons. This approach makes sense for us as a tech company, as these skills are essential for our work and the people we serve. It's proving to be a powerful way to help people understand each other better and work together more effectively.

Better Conversations is focused on people’s lived experiences and their personal agency. That is the level at which each one of us can attend to things and enable change to happen. It’s what matters most to us. It’s why we do what we do.

  through an invite from us or through one of our Partners.
- You must credit the Foundation and honour the Creative Commons license conditions. 

## Using this material yourself


If you want to learn how to deliver the course, please [get in touch](mailto:hello@betterconversations.foundation). There's some information that might be helpful to read through first in the sections below.

The Better Conversations Foundation supports the needs of the trainers delivering the Better Conversations course. Specifically, the Foundation does two things:

1. It enables trainers to deliver the Better Conversations course through course development and training support.
2. It provides sales and marketing support to fill the courses that trainers will deliver.

## How do we enable trainers?

We have designed the Better Conversations course to enable people with prior training or facilitator experience to deliver it. Our aim is to make this course straightforward to deliver and build on to create something authentic to you, if you'd like to do that. We're also very clear that this means making it possible for you to generate income through delivering the course.

## Some of the ways we help you:

- The Foundation provides “flight plans” for each module. A flight plan is a design-and-delivery document which contains everything that a trainer and technical producer will need for a tightly planned hour.
- We provide professionally-produced participant materials so a trainer won’t need to do that work. Trainers are welcome to use these materials as a source for their own training handouts.
- We can support you to produce and/or co-deliver your first courses
- Our app makes it easy to collect participant feedback
- Our app also generates a certificate of participation so that’s one less thing for a trainer to do

Trainers are welcome to adapt these flight plans for their own use. We’d be delighted if you shared your adaptations and improvements in our community of practitioners so we can learn from each other.

If you don’t have any prior experience as a trainer or facilitator and would still like to deliver this course, you would need to co-deliver a minimum of three Better Conversations courses with one of our Partners so you have the training you need to deliver the course well.

## What kind of marketing and sales support do we offer?

When we ask people who might deliver the course for us what support and resources they need to do that, we often hear that sales and marketing are the most difficult aspects for people. We are currently evolving the way we deliver marketing and sales support to trainers. Our current thinking is along the lines of providing:

**Course listings** If you are delivering public courses, we can list them on our websites - for example this one, that describes the course: https://betterconversations.courses

**Marketing engine** We can raise the profile of the course through working with our Marketing partners to create generic campaigns for the course. Since we have a global reach, we can help drive potential participants your way by helping them find a course running in their locality and language through a central site of course listings.

**Sales or marketing support** If you are bidding for private work, and need assistance, you can book a sales/marketing support call with us. We're aware that solo practitioners sometimes have difficulty with approaching companies and meeting procurement criteria and we would like to help.

One thing to note is that if you’ve renamed Better Conversations and claimed it as your own, that’s your right. But we can’t then provide you this marketing support.

If there's other support you think might benefit a community of practitioners, please do get in touch with us.

We will update this page with any updates to the support we can provide.

## Where can I find out more?

Our intention is to enable others. You can find detailed documentation, guidance and materials in the
[Course Documentation](https://betterconversations.foundation/documentation/500-the_course/index.html)
section of this site.

Please note that for some of the content you'll need to sign in with your email address.
