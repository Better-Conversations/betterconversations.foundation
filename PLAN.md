# BCF Website Optimization - Streamlined Plan
*2-Person Team | Updated October 2025 | Developed with Claude Code*

## Goal
Streamline the BCF website navigation for clarity and better user experience, while maintaining AI-friendly structure and SEO optimization.

---

## Current Situation (October 2025)
- ✅ **Basic SEO in place** (robots.txt, sitemap, meta tags)
- ✅ **Structured data implemented** (JSON-LD for Organization, Articles, Courses)
- ✅ **OpenGraph tags** for social media sharing
- ⚠️ **Navigation still cluttered** (26 links including incomplete pages)
- ⚠️ **Some pages under construction** (whitepapers, success stories)

---

## Phase 1: Navigation Streamlining (Current Focus)

### Approach: Hide, Don't Delete
**Strategy:** Remove incomplete/unnecessary pages from navigation while keeping them accessible via direct URLs. This allows faster deployment without requiring content consolidation work.

### Navigation Structure (16 Links)

**Home**

**Get Started** (2 links)
- Join the Foundation
- Attend a Course

**Our Approach** (2 links)
- Course Overview
- FAQs

**Open Resources** (2 links)
- Blog
- Open Content (documentation + download materials)

**Partner With Us** (4 links)
- For Organisations
- Deliver Courses
- Research Collaboration
- Support Us

**About** (5 links)
- Our Mission
- The Team
- Our Appreciation
- Ambassador Showcase
- Contact Us

**Search Button** (in navbar, not dropdown)

### Pages Hidden from Navigation (Still Accessible)
- Success Stories (`/stories`) - under construction placeholder
- Browse by Topic (`/tags`) - redundant with search
- Schedule a Call (`/get-started/schedule-call`) - functionality in Contact Us
- Download Materials (`/get-started/download`) - functionality in Open Content

### Content Temporarily Hidden from Build
- **Whitepapers** - Completely removed from build (October 2025) because they contain mocked-up example content not ready for public access
  - Directories renamed with underscore prefix (`_whitepapers`)
  - Collection disabled in content config
  - Utility functions updated to skip whitepaper processing
  - See AGENTS.md "Whitepapers Status" section for reintroduction instructions

## Current Status Summary

### Documentation Structure (October 2025)

The project has adopted the VSCode AGENTS.md file convention for AI-assisted development:
- **Root `AGENTS.md`** (formerly `CLAUDE.md`) - Project-wide rules and architecture
- **Nested `AGENTS.md` files** in specific directories for context-specific guidance:
  - `src/content/blog/AGENTS.md` - Blog content writing standards
  - `src/pages/blog/AGENTS.md` - Blog page development patterns
  - `src/components/AGENTS.md` - Component development rules
  - `src/pages/search/AGENTS.md` - Search functionality implementation
  - `src/pages/AGENTS.md` - General page development
  - `src/content/_whitepapers/AGENTS.md` - Whitepaper guidelines (for future use)

This structure enables AI coding assistants to automatically load the most relevant guidance based on which files are being edited, improving development efficiency and code consistency.

**What We Have:**
- Clean, functional site structure with 16 visible pages
- Solid SEO foundation (robots.txt, sitemap, meta tags)
- AI-readable content with JSON-LD structured data
- Modern blog with MDX support
- Powerful Typesense search functionality
- Breadcrumb navigation with schema markup
- Structured AI coding assistance via nested AGENTS.md files

**What We're Doing Now (Phase 1):**
- Streamlining navigation (hiding incomplete pages)
- Final cleanup of navigation links
- Minor content updates for consistency

**What's Next (Phase 2 & 3):**
- Enhanced AI discovery features
- Complete accessibility audit
- Finish whitepapers and success stories content
- Add analytics and engagement features

  "name": "Better Conversations Foundation",
  "description": "Professional communication skills training and resources",
  "lastUpdated": "2025-01-31",
  "content": {
    "courses": {
      "title": "Communication Skills Training",
      "url": "/approach/courses",
      "description": "Learn professional conversation and facilitation techniques"
    },
    "partnerships": {
      "organizations": "/partnership#organizations",
      "facilitators": "/partnership#facilitators",
