# BCF Website Optimization - Streamlined Plan
*2-Person Team | Updated November 2025 | Developed with Claude Code*

## Goal
Streamline the BCF website navigation for clarity and better user experience, while maintaining AI-friendly structure and SEO optimization.

---

## Current Situation (November 2025)
- ✅ **Basic SEO in place** (robots.txt, sitemap, meta tags)
- ✅ **Structured data implemented** (JSON-LD for Organization, Articles, Courses)
- ✅ **OpenGraph tags** for social media sharing
- ✅ **Navigation streamlined** (soft launched October 18, 2025)
- ✅ **All navigation links verified working** (November 20, 2025)
- ✅ **Documentation consolidated** to `/docs/` folder (November 20, 2025)
- ⚠️ **Search has 2 TODOs** (API key and collection name need updating)
- ⚠️ **Some pages under construction** (whitepapers, success stories)

---

## Phase 1: Navigation Streamlining ✅ **COMPLETE**

### Approach: Hide, Don't Delete
**Strategy:** Remove incomplete/unnecessary pages from navigation while keeping them accessible via direct URLs. This allows faster deployment without requiring content consolidation work.

### Current Navigation Structure (16 Links)
**Implemented October 18, 2025 | Verified November 20, 2025**

**Home**

**Get Started** (6 links)
- For Organisations → `/get-started/organisations`
- For Educators → `/get-started/educators`
- For Researchers → `/get-started/researchers`
- Join our Community → `/get-started/join-community`
- Experience the Course → `/get-started/attend-course`
- Book a Call → `/get-started/schedule-call`

**Our Approach** (2 links)
- Open Content → `/approach/open-content`
- FAQs → `/approach/faqs`

**Resources** (2 links)
- Blog → `/blog`
- Documentation → `https://betterconversations.foundation/documentation/index.html`

**About** (5 links)
- Our Mission → `/about/mission` (redirects to `/about#mission`)
- Our Team → `/about/team`
- Our Ambassadors → `/about/showcase`
- Our Appreciation → `/about/thanks`
- Contact Us → `/about/contact`

**Search Button** (in navbar, not dropdown)

### Pages Hidden from Navigation (Still Accessible)
- Success Stories (`/stories`) - under construction placeholder
- Browse by Topic (`/tags`) - redundant with search
- Download Materials (`/get-started/download`) - functionality in Open Content

### Content Temporarily Hidden from Build
- **Whitepapers** - Completely removed from build (October 2025) because they contain mocked-up example content not ready for public access
  - Directories renamed with underscore prefix (`_whitepapers`)
  - Collection disabled in content config
  - Utility functions updated to skip whitepaper processing
  - See `/docs/README.md` for reintroduction instructions

## Current Status Summary (November 2025)

### Documentation Structure

The project has consolidated all development documentation into the `/docs/` folder:
- **[/docs/README.md](./docs/README.md)** - Documentation overview, quick start, common tasks
- **[/docs/design-system.md](./docs/design-system.md)** - Brand colors, UI components, spacing, responsive design
- **[/docs/accessibility.md](./docs/accessibility.md)** - WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards, ARIA patterns, keyboard navigation
- **[/docs/development.md](./docs/development.md)** - TypeScript rules, component structure, build process
- **[/docs/content-guidelines.md](./docs/content-guidelines.md)** - UK English standards, metadata, writing style, SEO

The root `AGENTS.md` now serves as a concise quick reference for AI assistants, pointing to `/docs/` for comprehensive guidance.

This structure makes documentation more discoverable for human developers while maintaining AI assistant compatibility.

      "description": "Partner with BCF to bring professional communication training to your organization"
    },
    "resources": {
      "blog": "/blog",
      "documentation": "https://betterconversations.foundation/documentation/index.html",
