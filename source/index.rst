Open the door to better communication
-------------------------------------

Nice to meet you. We are the Better Conversations Foundation. We help people connect on a human level.

The BCF is dedicated to helping people around the world have Better 
Conversations in their professional and private lives. It doesn't
take much to make a big difference in the quality of your life. 

We have created the Better Conversations course which trainers, 
coaches, managers, and L&D professionals can freely download and 
incorporate into their work. 

You can `download the flight plans for the course here <https://betterconversations.foundation/l/flightplans>`_
and use them under the Creative Commons license.

If you are a member of the Foundation, `you can see the Course documentation here </documentation/index.html>`_,
and `access the private community here <https://community.betterconversations.foundation/>`_.


----------------------
Joining the Foundation
----------------------

Our community of fellow professionals support each other delivering the 
course, and also the use of Clean Language and Emergent Knowledge in 
business settings. 

If you would like to be considered for membership, please either:

- Ask an existing member to sponsor you. They can do that in the `bettercourses.org application <https://bettercourses.org>`_.
- `Arrange a call here </booking/get-to-know-you.html>`_, so we can have a conversation and decide if weâ€™re a good fit for each other


------------------
Attending a Course
------------------

If you would like to attend Better Conversations, there are many people 
providing both private and public courses.

We also work in partnership with other nonprofits whose members can
attend the course for free and are pre-approved for membership. 
You'll have a referral link via those organisations, if you can't find it
get in touch with us using the little support icon at the bottom right of 
this screen.
