What makes a course the Better Conversations course?

----
Aims

We encourage people to take what we've done and do their own thing with it; a
reasonable question is "at what point does it become a different course?". This 
is particularly important when people want to call their course "Better Conversations" 
and refer to the Better Conversations Foundation. It also defines who is eligible for
badges and certification as described in the `badges documentation </documentation/badges.html>`_.

Remember that we're not trying to restrict people from doing what they want,
we're trying to set expectations for what we can support. You can do what you 
want with this material subject to the Creative Commons license.

This our current attempt at that balance between celebrating diversity and a 
standadised course we can support. We welcome feedback and suggestions
and will adjust as needed.

What makes it the Better Conversations course?
----------------------------------------------

Before we get into the detail, just to emphasise the point, we're not trying to
restrict people from doing what they want. We're trying to set expectations for
what we can support.

If you want to call your course "Better Conversations", and associate yourself
with us, then this is what we need you to do.

Precision matters in these things, so the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this are to be
interpreted as described in RFC 2119 which we've referenced below.


- You MUST follow a flight plan. This is the core of the course and the
  foundation of everything we do. It's what we can support, along with the Handbook.

- You MUST follow flight plans which are of the same major version as the current
  course as provided by the Foundation. At the time of writing this is version 3, 
  the latest version is 3.0.4 which means you can use any version from 3.0.0 to 3.0.4.

- You MUST keep modules 1-5 intact, in the same order, with the same names. Module
  6 is optional and if you include it, you SHOULD customise it to your
  context.

- You MUST use the same models and exercises.

- You MAY NOT substitute any of the models with your own.

- You MAY add additional modules, either at the start or end of your course.

- You SHOULD use your own words in the content of the modules, but you MUST be
  aiming for the same outcomes as the original course. We know that effective
  training means you need to use your own voice.
