====================
Setting Expectations
====================

What we're trying to do with the Foundation and the course
is unusual and will likely be new for most people. To avoid
confusion we thought we should be explicit about expectations
etc. 

If you've got experience of other Open Source projects, you'll
recognise a lot of this.
