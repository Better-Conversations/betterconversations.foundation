============
Work with Us
============

We work with a wide range of partners to help us achieve our mission. We are always looking for new partners to work with, and we are open to new ideas and ways of working. 

We want to help people to help their teams, communities and organisations have better conversations. We believe that the best way to do this is to work with others who share our values and purpose.

We'd especially like to hear from you if you are a non-profit, charity or social enterprise, or you work in a community or public sector organisation. We are also interested in working with businesses who share our values and purpose.
