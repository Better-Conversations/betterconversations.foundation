# How to work with us

## You get out what you put in (hopefully more)


## This community is built on goodwill

Talk about what our Partners have done

Talk about the support we get from Faculty and how they support each other

## Go solo or go far

Quote African proverb?

Discuss how working together brings benefits

Mention some of the learnings from working with the Faculty and why we did that

Say that you can take this material and deliver it yourself, however we think the community will enhance each other's offers

Talk about what we hope the community aspect might work

## Use the course to deliver the course

What we hope is that you bring the course to life through your own unique personality and by modelling the skills we train
