Crediting/Referencing Us
------------------------

Many people feel they want to refer to the Foundation and/or credit
us for this work.

If you want to refer to us, then please use the following text:

"The Better Conversations Foundation https://betterconversations.foundation"
  
We won't be upset if you don't refer to us; we're just delighted our ideas travel.

A Note About Branding
---------------------

If you want to use our work in a commercial context, and would prefer to
use your own branding, that is within the terms of the license and we'd 
encourage you to do so. This especially applies to the use of the course
content internally in a company or organisation. Please do put your logo
on it. Just make sure you retain somewhere a reference to the Foundation
and the CC-BY-SA-4.0 license - even if it is in small text at the bottom.

If you take this and build something new, we'd love to hear about it. 
Please don't call it "Better Conversations" as it'll confuse people.

What Copyright Covers
---------------------

Ideas are not protected by Copyright. Patents are what protects ideas and we
haven't applied for a Patent (and indeed, what's here probably isn't
patentable).

What that means is you can pretty much do what you want with the ideas and
concepts we've documented. It's only when you start copying our text and images
that you need to abide by the copyright agreement.
