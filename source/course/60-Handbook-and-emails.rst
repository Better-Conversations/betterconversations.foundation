---------------
Course Handbook
---------------

We have prepared a handbook for participants which you can download
as a PDF `here </documentation/course-materials/handbook.html>`_ 
It contains information about the course and also the material that's
taught. 


---------------
Email Templates
---------------

We have prepared a set of email templates that you can use to invite
participants and followup after each module `here </documentation/course-materials/email_templates.html>`_

We recognise that people want to customise the handbook, with their own
branding, contact information, etc. People have also taken individual sections
and e.g. on State and used them in other circumstances like coaching. Please
get in touch if you would like to do this.
