Notes for facilitators
----------------------

This module brings it all together; make use of the skills 
covered in the course to deliver this module and encourage 
feedback from the participants.

Timing is sometimes a challenge; there's a lot of opportunity for 
discussion and reflection. Keep the group on track.

The power of this module is in the facilitator’s ability to
"walk the talk" and demonstrate the skills covered in the course. 

Examples of how to do this are:

**State** - Manage your state before and during the module
to receive feedback in the spirit of improving the course.

**Assumptions** - Check your assumptions about what is being
communicated. People are not going to deliver the feedback 
perfectly. Assume they have good intentions and ask questions 
to clarify any assumptions that you might be making.

**Context** - the feedback is given in the context of the course 
and what the participants or fellow facilitators have witnessed. 
They may have context they are bringing to the course that 
you don’t know and understand. Don’t take the feedback personally.

**Listening with curiosity** - sometimes just listening is enough. 
Gathering feedback on the flip also shows you’ve listened and 
heard the feedback. Accept the feedback - they are sharing their 
experience and context with you. Ask Clean Language Questions to 
clarify and show how the questions can be used in an everyday situation.

**Feedback** - demonstrate how to unpack the evidence and 
thoughts/feelings behind the feedback. Ask the questions suggested to 
separate out evidence, inference, impact and intention.
