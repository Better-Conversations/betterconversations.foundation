==========
The Course
==========

`Better Conversations <https://betterconversations.courses>`_ is at its heart, a
course to teach people to have better conversations in everyday contexts using
Clean Language.

The course was initially developed through 15 pilots over 3 years, and through
training contracts with organisations such as government agencies, including
our sister software company, Amphora Research Systems and evolved it so that
any trainer can deliver it effectively straight off the bat.

We now have a network of trainers across the world who have delivered the
course to hundreds of people. We continue to observe and learn from their
experiences and feedback. We have also developed resources to 
support the course, including a handbook, a set of emails to send to attendees
before and after the course, module plans and facilitator guides.

The Foundation provides support to trainers and facilitators to help them
deliver the course. This includes a community of practice, tailored support
with marketing materials and advice on how to deliver the course effectively.
We run our own 'Experience Courses' and peer support sessions to help trainers
develop their skills and confidence. These Experience Courses are designed to
help trainers understand the course from the perspective of an attendee, and to
help them develop their own style of delivery. These are run by experienced
trainers and are a great way to learn from others. We do this to provide a hgih
quality experience for those learning to deliver the course. Our courses are
invite-only as we want to ensure our Partners are able to offer their own
public and bespoke courses on a commercial basis.

The course uses Clean Language principles and practical applications to prime
attendees to achieve better conversations, with peers, family and friends. Itâ€™s
been designed for online delivery but works well in person too.

It's a project that has evolved through collaboration, continual innovation and
applied playfulness. Our friends and fellow travellers on this journey are the
main reason we have got this far. And we hope, as you are reading this, you
might decide to join us.
