# What links Bulls and Better Conversations?[^Picasso]

[^Picasso]: Revised from an original post on the Better Conversations [community](https://community.betterconversations.foundation/t/what-links-bulls-and-better-conversations/516) on 6 February 2024.

We’ve been working on Better Conversations for a while now. We've iterated and improved the course and learned a lot along the way. We’ve had to make some tough decisions about what to include and what to leave out, which we are often asked about. This article is an attempt to explain our thinking by framing it in the context of Picasso’s Bull Series.

In this work, Picasso was experimenting with new media and taking an unconventional approach. He created a series of prints that show progression towards the essence of a bull. Over a period of time he found a representation that was enough to evoke the idea of a bull with just 12 lines[^artsy].

It’s a wonderful insight into the creative process. First, the representation gets more complicated as more ideas/features are added. Then it is stripped down, deliberately focused on what matters in this context.

What is left is enough. Focusing attention on the simplest elements helps us come to terms with complexity.

## So what’s this got to do with Better Conversations?

The approaches that inspired earlier versions of the Better Conversations course come from the field of Clean Language[^wiki] (also referred to as ‘Clean’). David Grove developed Clean as part of his psychotherapeutic practice over many years and collaborations.

[^wiki]: See [Clean Language on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Language)

David’s original work was extended by others through developments like Symbolic Modelling and Systemic Modelling. We can work with Clean in specialised modalities in coaching and therapy. The picture has lots of features and detail, like those in the middle of Picasso’s series. And in such circumstances that’s what’s needed: attention to these details.

David continued to innovate his approach[^Wilson], exploring the spatial organisation of information in client’s minds, using more scripted processes to enable that[^Campbell]. He called this field Emergent Knowledge (EK). For me, this is similar to the progression of Picasso’s images of the bull. The space and relationship *between* the lines are as important as the lines themselves.

[^Wilson]: See [The Work and Life of David Grove*, Carol Wilson, Chapter 1](https://www.troubador.co.uk/bookshop/health-wellbeing/the-work-and-life-of-david-grove)
[^Campbell]: See [Panning for Your Client's Gold*, Gina Campbell, p13.](https://www.balboapress.com/en-gb/bookstore/bookdetails/703789-panning-for-your-clients-gold)

Most Clean-based trainings now come from a perspective of a one-to-one engagement with a client or external interventions into organisations. Whilst some people have the time and resources to master Clean and EK, others don’t. And they may not need to, for what they would like to do. There’s a desire to be able to apply these skills in new settings, for example from within a team or organisation, minimising external interventions. That’s been the case in our own experience and from talking to other people.

After many years of research, testing, listening to feedback and improving Better Conversations, we seem to have a version of the course that is ‘enough’ to allow people to use Clean Language every day and informally, without having to ‘contract’ for it. We’ve also taken the unconventional approach of making the course materials freely available to use under Creative Commons. What we’ve done makes complete sense to us, because we run a tech company, not a training company. These skills are essential for the type of work we do and for the people we serve.

A consequence of this is that we have had to put aside some things and refine some concepts, models and details to make it make sense. And that has now set us on a different pathway to the original approaches.

## Why make these choices? 

The short answer is that we tried these concepts and models, and they were less effective than we hoped they’d be, for a work context and for the people we serve. We’ve replaced them with simpler concepts and models that work with what we are placing attention on, and that are just enough to help frame the topics we explore.

For example, we’ve considered carefully how we introduce Clean Language to people, and decided not to cover the question that elicits metaphor (“…that’s like what?”). This question requires advanced trainings and framing in a professional coaching and therapeutic context. We’ve also moved away from a lot of the models used in Systemic Modelling as there are nuances in how they are used in different contexts.

Better Conversations is focused on people’s lived experiences and their personal agency. That is the level at which each one of us can attend to things and enable change to happen. It’s what matters most to us. It’s why we need it to spread far and wide, with the help of this community.

I’ll leave the last word to Picasso describing his work:

> But isn’t it strange that it can be done through such simple means? Whatever is most abstract may perhaps be the summit of reality.
