# Credentials/Badges are here!

We are now ready to issue credentials/badges which you can use on LinkedIn etc.

We will be gradually emailing people who have completed the course to get
them to claim their badges.

We are also developing the capability for our Faculty and Partners to issue
badges to participants on their private courses, which should be a major
step forward in terms of credibility and recognition. We'll announce more
in the [community](https://community.betterconversations.foundation/t/credentials-badges-are-here/509) when this is ready.

Here's an example [from Chandima's LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chandimadutton/):
