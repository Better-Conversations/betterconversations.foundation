As part of the promotion for the event at the Open University next week
@russ_lewis and @lizmoody kindly arranged for us to have a view recorded by
the OU’s media team. And oh my, what a difference an experienced producer
makes! We spoke for ~20 minutes which they then edited down to this 3
minute video.

You might find this 3 minute video an interesting watch in terms of how we
explain things and also what the OU editors found relevant to have in the
video, of all of the things that we might say about the course and the
Foundation.

If you’re in the area, this event looks like it will be awesome and it is
very reasonably priced too!

You can see the video on Russ Lewis’s `LinkedIn Post <https://www.linkedin.com/posts/russlewis-agile-ways-of-working_opensource-training-leadershipdevelopment-activity-7242908893431963650-PSZ_/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop>`_.

    It was a great event, and we've put the Flight Plan we used in the 
    `community <https://community.betterconversations.foundation/t/business-agility-institute-workshop-flight-plan/504?u=simonc>`_
    in the hope that others will find it useful. The presentation we used
    is `here <https://community.betterconversations.foundation/t/quick-thoughts-on-our-talk-at-the-open-university-conference/501?u=simonc>`_.
