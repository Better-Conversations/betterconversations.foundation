============================

As a general rule we release our IP under either a Creative Commons license or an Open Source license 
depending on the nature of the work [#f1]_. We believe that the best way to get our work out there is to make it
available under the most permissive terms possible.

.. [#f1] "Creative Commons" is appropriate for works that are copyrighted but where we want to allow people 
   to use our work under certain conditions. "Open Source" is appropriate for software.
