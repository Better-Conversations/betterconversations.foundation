The Better Conversations Foundation Ltd is a company registered with Companies House

As a "Foundation" it is a company limited by guarantee, which means that it has no shareholders 
and cannot pay dividends - it is a non profit. The `relevant details from companies house are

  To use this word in your proposed name, the company should normally be limited by guarantee. It should have a pool of money, or a regular source of income to promote its objects. You will need to confirm this when you submit your application.

  A non-profit distribution clause should be included in the articles of association. The non-profit clause provides that any profits are used to further the objects of the company and not paid to the members as dividends.

  In the case of a business name, the articles or relevant governance document should include similar clauses and you should provide a copy when you submit your application.

It is governed by its Articles of Association, which are the rules by which the company is run. You can read them here - they're 
just the model articles from Companies House, with a few tweaks to make them more relevant to us.
