The Board
---------

The Foundation is run by a Board of Directors, who are responsible for the governance of the Foundation. 

- Chandima Dutton, CEO and course owner
- Simon Coles, Chairman and CTO

Board members work closely together, but have formal meetings ("a directorsâ€™ meeting") as needed which are minuted on this page. 

This meets the requirement of the articles that "The directors must ensure that the company keeps a record, in writing, for at least 10 years from the date of the decision recorded, of every unanimous or majority decision taken by the directors".
