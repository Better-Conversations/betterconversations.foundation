    A company is governed by its Articles of Association, which are the rules by which the company is run. Our articles
    are just the model articles from Companies House, with the addition of the B-Corp requirements. 

    You can find more information about the B-Corp legal requirements `here <https://bcorporation.uk/b-corp-certification/before-you-certify/legal-requirement/>`_.
    We took the model wording from `this document <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h0iswtPoGeKW3nJqwketYsXBsFKn4aG5/view>`_ for companies limited by guarantee.

    The articles are structured into 5 parts:

      1. `Interpretation and defining the liabilities of members <part1.html>`_
      2. `How the Directors - their role, powers and responsibilities, as well as how they are appointed and meetings are run <part2.html>`_
      3. `Members - how meetings are run and how members can participate <part3.html>`_  (note for our purposes, there's one "Member", our holding company Pithos)
      4. `Various administrative arrangements <part4.html>`_
      5. `The B-Corp requirements for what Directors must consider when making decisions <part5.html>`_
