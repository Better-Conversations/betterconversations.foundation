Our Commercial Arm
------------------

If you want to engage with an entity that is ISO 9001 certified, is VAT registered, 
and has a long history then we're happy to work with you through Amphora Research Systems Ltd.

The Foundation is a non-profit and is not set up to do business in the same way.

In addition - we're here for our partners. Nothing is more important to us than the relationships we have with our partners.

Amphora Research Systems will happily engage with organisations who want Better Conversations at scale. We'll provide 
the reassurance of a long-standing, well-regarded company that has been in business for over 15 years.

We'll rely on our existing partners and faculty to help us deliver the course, and we'll be working with them to 
ensure that the course is delivered to the highest standards.

For smaller engagements, we'll strongly encourage you to work with our partners, who are all experts in their field.
