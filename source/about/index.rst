About Us
========

The Foundation is a not-for-profit organisation, founded by Simon Coles and Chandima Dutton, to help people have better conversations at work and beyond. We believe that better conversations lead to better relationships, better decisions, and better outcomes. We want to help people to be their unique selves, and to connect with others in a way that is meaningful and fulfilling.

        Simon is the CEO of a successful privately owned tech company. He built the company from start-up to a mature business, based on the principles of open and honest communication. That 20-year journey led to the creation of the Foundation, to share the lessons learned and to help people be more effective at work.
