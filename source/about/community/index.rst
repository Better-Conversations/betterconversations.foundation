==================================
The Better Conversations Community
==================================

You might think Better Conversations is a course, perhaps even a set of
flight plans. In fact, all of that comes from our community. 

The Foundation is a not-for-profit organisation that exists to support the
community.

This page documents how the community is governed.

Note that this Code of Conduct is for the Better Conversations community,
not the Better Conversations Foundation. Employees of the Foundation are
subject to the Foundation's Employee Handbook and disciplinary process
which may be more stringent than the Code of Conduct, have different
processes, and have more severe penalties.
