Faculty
-------

Faculty members are trusted to deliver the course to a consistently high
standard. They often deliver the course on behalf of the Foundation on 
a voluntary basis in our "Experience Courses" as well as in their own 
private work. 

We could never have achieved what we have without the support of our
Faculty, who have generously given their time and expertise to help us
create our content. We are grateful for their support and are proud to work
with them in our community and in our commercial work.

Our current Faculty includes:

Ambassadors
-----------

The Better Conversations Foundation has a number of Ambassadors who are
trusted to be ambassadors for the Foundation and to help us spread the word
about the Foundation and the course.

There's no specific criteria for being an Ambassador. It's more Chandima 
and Simon realising someone "gets it", is passionate about the 
Foundation's mission, and can communicate it effectively.

Ideally there's an Ambassador present for every Experience Course, to provide
the Foundation's context and quality control. 

Current Ambassadors include:
