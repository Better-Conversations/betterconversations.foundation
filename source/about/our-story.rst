This is the story of how the course was developed, and how the Foundation
came to be.

Simon Coles of Amphora Research Systems has been working with Clean
Language since the late 1990s following a course run by Caitlin Walker at
`New Information Paradigms <https://nipltd.com>`_. This later became known
as "Metaphors at Work" and we ended up being an example for some Open
University videos which are still on YouTube: `Open University Video
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKpKzN5fQmc>`_.

At NIP Simon pioneered the first commercial Electronic Laboratory Notebook
(ELN) system, and in 2003 did a management buyout from NIP to form `Amphora
Research Systems <https://www.amphora-research.com/>`_ as an independent
company.

It was evident that Clean Language was a powerful tool for improving
conversations in the business, especially in the sales process, and so
Simon started to look for ways to train more people in the approach. This
proved to be difficult, although Simon managed to find Caitlin Walker again
sometime around 2012 and Caitlin ran a series of Clean Language workshops
with the sales team.

Around this time, Amphora got interested in neurodiversity and the idea
that different people have different ways of processing information. This
led to an engagement with Nancy Doyle of `Genius Within
<https://geniuswithin.org/>`_, where underpinned by Clean Language, the
Amphora team started to explore how they could work better together using
the more detailed information gained from WAIS assessments.

By this time Clean Language was used across the business, in a light but
important way. It was important that new hires were trained in Clean
Language, and that the training was delivered in a way that was accessible
and repeatable.

It soon became clear that the existing Clean Language training was not
meeting the needs of the business. Not only were their logistical
challenges, but the "Pure" Clean courses were aimed at Coaches and
Therapists, or Facilitators, and not ordinary people working in a business.

In addition there were some dogmatic views about what Clean Language was
and was not, and "Systemic Modelling" had grown to incorpoate all sorts of
things which weren't Clean Language at all, nor appropriate for the
workplace.

Around 2017 Simon started to think about how he could develop a training
course that would be more effective. 

- It had to be accessible and repeatable
- It had to be online
- It had to be modular, and fit into people's working day - an hour at a
  time
- It had to be consistent, so that colleagues who did the course at
  different times would learn the same things
- It had to be run over a realtively short timescale - the original course
  was 4 modules over 4 weeks
- It had to be scalable
- It had to be robust and reliable when delivered to diverse participants
  across cultures and contexts
- It had to support employees with any behaviour change that is needed for
  better conversations, and be relevant and easy to apply in business
  situations

Simon tried to various approaches including recording short videos
explaining the approach, but these didn't work. He realised that he needed
a course that was interactive and involved practicing the skills, not
watching videos.

Thus began a long and winding road of development, with the first
experimental course being run externally in 2019, and has been iteratively
developed since then.

Working from an approach which is very natural in the software industry,
the course has always been "Open Source" and has been developed with the
support of a wide community. 

Chandima Dutton joined Amphora in 2022 as Head of People and has been
instrumental in the development of the course from an internal tool to
something that people around the world can rely on to incorporate into
their work.

In 2024 Simon and Chandima formalised the Better Conversations Foundation
to support people who use the course and make it available to a wider
audience.

Under Chandima's leadership, the Foundation has been able to invest in the
development of the course and the detailed documentation we provide on this
site.

The Foundation is also able to support the development of new courses and
resources, and to support people who want to help the world communicate
just a little bit better, every day.

We're excited for the future and hope you can join us in this great
adventure!
