# Our Story

This is the story of how the course was developed, and how the Foundation came to be.

<!-- ```{todo}

Rewrite origin story - Simon to check these points are accurate
- Simon's early career in a software company where he met Caitlin Walker through a training course
- The approach later came to be known as Metaphors at Work; link to Open Uni course
- Simon and Allison bought out his part of the company and started Amphora Research Systems
- Simon realised he was using Clean Language very naturally in his sales conversations
- He engaged Caitlin [and Nancy Doyle?] to run some trainings in Clean Language; these were in person and involved the whole team
- [Simon realised that Clean Language was also useful for understanding neurodiversity; although some aspects of Clean Language were difficult for some people, the overall effect was positive]
- Simon wanted Clean Language not just in the sales team but throughout the whole business
- He couldn't find a training course that matched what his business needed
- Simon wondered: "If we want more Clean Language in an organisation, how do we do that? And what happens when you bring someone new into the company, when everyone else has had Clean Language training?"
- Another issue was being able to train people in Clean Language in a way that was accessible and repeatable, for example part-time employees who had caring responsibilities that meant they couldn't attend a full-day training or travel far from home
- Simon tried to various approaches including recording short videos explaining the approach, but these didn't work. He realised that he needed a course that was interactive and involved practicing the skills, not watching videos.
- He came up with some criteria for the course he needed:
    - It had to be accessible and repeatable
    - It had to be online
    - It had to be modular, and fit into people's working day - an hour at a time
    - It had to be consistent, so that colleagues who did the course at different times would learn the same things
    - It had to be run over a realtively short timescale - the original course was 4 modules over 4 weeks
    - It had to be scalable
    - It had to be robust and reliable when delivered to diverse participants across cultures and contexts
    - It had to support employees with any behaviour change that is needed for better conversations, and be relevant and easy to apply in business situations

- The first version of the course was run in 2019, and has been iteratively developed since then.
