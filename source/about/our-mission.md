# Our Mission

```{todo}

Update for this:
- Also mention something about working through partners and empowering people who are in a natural place to give a course like this
- The Vision Story - A dedicated “Our Vision” page could be added to the website to provide a more in-depth explanation of the foundation’s long-term goals and vision for improving conversations across different sectors and communities.
- Add image back in

We want to enable people to have better conversations, better relationships and better outcomes. We will do this by bringing the power of Clean Language into organisations, on a global scale.

We have a disruptive model for how we like to work with people to achieve our aims. It's about enabling others, growing organically and challenging norms.

We bring our capabilities, skills and experience and encourage you to bring yours. And we achieve more together that way than we can possibly do alone.
