AI Use
========

We use AI extensively to help us in our work. Here's just some examples.

Our web site is written in reStructuredText, which is basically plain
text with some additional formatting. We use `Cursor <https://www.cursor.com/>`_ as an editor, 
which not only helps with formatting, but also allows us to easily
use LLMs like Claude Sonnet 3.5, DeepSeek and Gemini Flash 2.0 to 
help us write the content. We can also use the "Cursor Rules" feature
to help us write documentation that adheres to our style preferences. 

We use OpenAI's GPT o1-pro with Deep Research to help us
research and draft articles where we're looking to position what we're 
doing in the context of other work. 

AI helps us use large amounts of knowledge to inform our work, and to draft
content quickly and effectively.

Human Author, AI assistant
--------------------------

In all cases, tthere is always a human checking and often revising the content.
If you see something written here, it's been written by a human, not AI. 
The difference is that the human will have had extensive conversations with the
LLM to research and refine the content. 

This is very similar to how good programmers now use AI. You don't just copy
and paste code from the AI into your editor, you have a conversation with the
AI to research and refine the code.
