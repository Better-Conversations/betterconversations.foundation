Stable Links
============

Sometimes you need to link to a page that is not going to change, perhaps to send out to your course
participants or post in forums. No one likes a broken link!

This is a list of links that are stable and will not change, and will redirect the user to the 
current correct page. So as we issue new flight plans reorganise the site, 
https://betterconversations.foundation/l/flightplans will always take you to the current list of flight plans.

Some material on this site is public, some requires a login, and that's also indicated in the table below.
