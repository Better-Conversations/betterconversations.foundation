Managing Breakout Rooms

.. note::
   This guidance reflects different approaches we've seen work well. 
   Your style and context will influence which approach fits best.

About this guidance
-------------------
Breakout rooms are central to the Better Conversations experience. While the technical setup is standardized, how producers manage timing, communication, and coordination varies based on their style, the facilitator's approach, and group dynamics. This guidance shares approaches that experienced producers have found effective.

When to consider this
---------------------
This guidance is particularly relevant when you:

- Are new to producing Better Conversations sessions
- Need to handle groups with odd numbers of participants
- Want to refine your breakout room management style
- Are coordinating with different facilitator preferences

     - What to do
     - Why it works
     - Considerations
   * - Standard approach
     - Producers supporting facilitators who rely on consistent timing or when training new facilitators/producers
     - * Set personal timer for halfway point (e.g., watch, phone)
       * Send broadcast at exactly 50% elapsed
       * Use standard message: "Halfway through, you have X minutes left"
       * Give time warnings at consistent intervals
     - * Participants can pace their conversations
       * Facilitators can rely on timing
       * Creates predictable rhythm
       * Reduces uncertainty in breakouts
     - * Requires constant attention to timers
       * Less flexibility for engaged groups
       * May interrupt at awkward moments
   * - Flexible timing
     - Producers who read room energy supporting facilitators who adapt to group needs
     - * Extend time slightly for when groups are engaged and you have enough time to do so
     - * Honors natural conversation flow
       * Allows for richer discussions
       * Responds to group energy
       * Builds participant trust
     - * Requires good judgment about time extensions
       * May throw off module timing - be aware that this is as much your responsibility as the facilitators'
       * Needs clear delivery team communication
       * Risk of inconsistency between sessions

Finding your style
------------------
Questions to help you choose:

- Do you prefer predictability or flexibility in your producer role?
- How comfortable are you making quick timing decisions?
- What's your communication style with facilitators during sessions?

Things to experiment with:

- work with the facilitators to find a style that works for you - notice what feels sustainable to all of you
- Develop silent signals with your facilitator for timing adjustments
- Be prepared to interrupt the facilitator politely if they are not on track with the timing - it doesn't need to be a long statement, something like "We have 5 minutes left" is enough

What we've learned
------------------
Groups of three consistently need 30-50% more time than pairs. Experienced producers build this into their mental calculations rather than being surprised, and communicate this to the facilitators. When working with two facilitators, having one join a breakout to avoid trios has become standard practice - it's worth discussing this approach during briefing.

The Foundation's standard breakout room settings work reliably:
- Manual assignment (create rooms early)
- No participant room choice
- Automatic movement to breakouts
- Automatic closure with 10-second countdown
- Timing notifications enabled

Small courses (1-4 participants) still benefit from breakout rooms, so don't skip them. The act of leaving and returning to the main room creates important psychological shifts that enhance learning, even with just two people per room. It also gives you a chance to check in with the facilitator and see how they are doing.

Community experiences
---------------------
Experienced producers share these insights:

- Create rooms during the opening segment while participants are settling in - it's one less thing to manage later. This is suggested in the flight plan to remind you!
- The halfway message serves as both information and reassurance that someone is monitoring time
- Where there is an odd number of participants, communicate with the facilitator about whether they'll join a breakout - this affects your room setup
- Some producers use phone timers, others use Zoom's built-in timer, and some use physical timers - find what doesn't distract you from other tasks
