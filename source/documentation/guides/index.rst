Guides

These are the guides that the Foundation find useful in delivering courses - they are not meant to be prescriptive, but rather to be a starting point for you to find and adapt your own style.

The Better Conversations Community is a place where you can discuss and learn from others how you use this checklist to reinforce the relevance of the
course to your wider context. If you aren't already a member you can get in touch here: `hello@betterconversations.foundation <mailto:hello@betterconversations.foundation>`_
