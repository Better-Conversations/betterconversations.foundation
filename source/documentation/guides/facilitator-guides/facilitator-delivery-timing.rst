Module Delivery Timing

.. note::
   This guidance reflects different approaches we've seen work well. 
   Your style and context will influence which approach fits best.

About this guidance
-------------------
Managing time during module delivery is both an art and a science. While our flight plans provide minute-by-minute structure, how you work within that structure varies based on your facilitation style, group dynamics, and comfort with pacing. This guidance shares approaches that experienced facilitators have found helpful.

When to consider this
---------------------
This guidance is particularly relevant when you:

- Are new to delivering Better Conversations modules
- Are working with groups that seem to need different pacing
- Want to refine your timing management approach
- Are adapting to unexpected situations during delivery

   * - Approach

     - What to do
     - Why it works
     - Considerations
   * - Front-loading
     - Facilitators who like buffer time and groups that warm up quickly
     - * Start punctually and move briskly through the first 30 minutes, banking time for later use
       * Aim to reach the 30-minute mark about 5 minutes ahead of schedule
     - * Creates breathing room for rich discussions later
       * Reduces anxiety about running over
       * Allows flexibility when groups get deeply engaged
     - * May feel rushed initially to participants
       * Requires confidence to move groups along early
       * Works well with a fast verbal/energetic style
       * Works best with clear signposting: "We'll have more time to explore this shortly"
   * - Steady rhythm
     - Facilitators who prefer consistency and groups that need predictability
     - * Maintain even pacing throughout, hitting each timing mark within 30 seconds
       * The first and last 5 minutes are designed as buffers for latecomers/early leavers, so take advantage of that time to build energy and momentum
     - * Creates a reliable rhythm participants can feel
       * Easier to maintain energy levels
       * Reduces decision-making about when to speed up/slow down
     - * Less flexibility for spontaneous deep dives
       * Requires good time awareness throughout
       * May need to gently interrupt rich discussions

Finding your style
------------------
Questions to help you choose:

- Do you naturally keep an eye on the clock, or do you tend to lose track of time when engaged? What support do your need from the delivery team and/or technology to help you stay on track?
- Does having buffer time make you feel secure or tempted to over-extend discussions? How do you manage this?
- How comfortable are you moving groups along when they're engaged but time is short? What strategies do you use to manage this?

Things to experiment with:

- Try front-loading in one session and steady pacing in another - notice which feels more natural
- Practice transition phrases: "That's a great point - let's hold that thought for our next discussion" or "We cover that in more detail in the next breakout/module"
- Use producer signals to help maintain awareness without clock-watching (producers can also politely remind you of the time).

What we've learned
------------------
Concentration typically dips after 20 minutes, which is why we structure breakouts at roughly 20 and 40 minutes in each module. This natural rhythm becomes familiar to participants as they attend more sessions, which helps engagement and managing expectations.

The "chunking" principle (keeping segments under 20 minutes) works across all facilitation styles. How you transition between chunks is where personal style shows: some use energy and pace, others use pause and reflection.

Groups of three in breakouts nearly always need extra time - about 30-50% more. Experienced facilitators build this expectation into their mental timing rather than being surprised each time. We always pair up participants in breakouts to help manage this, sending a facilitator into a breakout if there are odd numbers of participants. 

We also deliver with two facilitators to help vary the pace and energy of the session. Participants are often surprised by this, but we've had feedback that it helps them feel more engaged and supported.

Community experiences
---------------------
Different facilitators use different strategies for unpacking discussions:

- Unpack person by person in smaller groups, but switch to group summaries when we have more than 12 participants. Sometimes the participants will naturally speak for their pair.

- Gauge the group's chattiness in the early stages. If they're talkers, increase your pace - avoid the temptation to ask additional questions. 

- For quieter individuals, you might want to ask them towards the end of the session to share their thoughts, if they have not already done so. Over time, the more talkative people understand that they need to encourage everyone to contribute.

- Monitor who talks and how long they are likely to talk for when you ask a question. A rule of thumb is 1 minute for each person who talks (2 minutes if they are chatty).
