    Note that the facilitator standing up and writing on the flipchart means

    - They can put more energy into the group just by standing up and moving
    - They can control the pace of the group by writing slowly or quickly
    - They can let someone know their contribution has been heard by writing it down, and it is time to stop by turning around and putting the cap on their pen

Flipchart management is key to delivering Better Conversations online. This pattern provides 
practical guidance for using flipcharts effectively in virtual environments where traditional 
in-person techniques need adaptation.

-----------------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`construction;1.8rem` Using this pattern
-----------------------------------------------------------

This pattern helps facilitators:

- Maintain participant engagement through clear visual aids
- Ensure content visibility for all participants
- Manage cognitive load in virtual environments
- Create dynamic, interactive learning spaces online
- Support neurodiverse participants effectively
- Capture emergent discussions visually

Essential for:

- All Better Conversations modules requiring visual aids
- Group discussions needing visual capture
- Complex concept explanations
- Collaborative learning activities

:material-outlined:`route;1.8rem` Flow
--------------------------------------

**Before Your Session:**

1. Test camera angle and lighting
2. Prepare key headers/frameworks
3. Verify technical setup with producer
4. Check visibility at different zoom levels
5. Practice writing size and spacing

**During Your Session:**

1. Coordinate spotlight timing with producer
2. Write clearly and verbalize content
3. Monitor chat for visibility issues
4. Check participant engagement
5. Maintain consistent positioning

**After Your Session:**

1. Debrief with producer
2. Document any issues
3. Consider improvements
4. Share learnings

:material-outlined:`groups;1.8rem` Delivery Roles
-------------------------------------------------

**Facilitators:**

- Write clearly and concisely
- Maintain group energy through movement
- Control session pace through writing
- Signal listening through documentation
- Manage group flow with pen gestures

**Producers:**

- Manage technical aspects
- Monitor chat for visibility issues
- Coordinate timing with facilitator
- Support accessibility needs
- Handle technical difficulties

Note that we do not recommend using the Zoom spotlight feature 
as the facilitator will not be able to see all participants. 
Advise participants to pin the facilitator's video so that they 
can see them (this is covered in the Module 1 flight plan).

**Participants:**

- Contribute to discussions
- Use chat for accessibility
- Adjust views as needed

Note that we advise the particopants it is not necessary to be 
able to read all of the  text on the flipchart, but they should be 
able to see the facilitator writing. This is because the writing is 
what engages people and shows that they are being listened to.

------------------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`content_paste;1.8rem` Practical Examples
------------------------------------------------------------

**Physical Setup:**

- Flipchart at slight angle to camera where possible (common for most flipchart stands)
- Consistent lighting setup
- Thick markers (chisel tip)
- Clear camera view
- Stable positioning

**Writing Techniques:**

- Large, clear text
- Fewer, impactful words using the words of the participants
- Adequate white space
- Consistent symbols
- Clear structure (examples are provided)

**Common Challenges & Solutions:**

- Glare issues → Adjust lighting angle
- Writing size → Use fewer, bigger words
- Technical issues → Have backup plans
- Visibility problems → Regular checks
- Engagement drops → Use movement/energy

Note that we do not recommend using a physical whiteboard due to glare issues.

:material-outlined:`science;1.8rem` Testing
-------------------------------------------

Check effectiveness through:

- Pre-session technical checks
- Participant feedback on visibility
- Montioring engagement monitoring
- Producer-facilitator debriefs

----------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`touch_app;1.8rem` Implementation
----------------------------------------------------

**Technical Setup:**

- Test camera angles
- Set up lighting
- Prepare backup options

**Facilitation Techniques:**

- Stand up for energy
- Use writing pace deliberately
- Signal through pen gestures
- Balance detail vs visibility
- Regular eye contact with participants from time to time

-------------------------------------------------------
