Short Description
-----------------
Ensuring clear and effective use of flipcharts in online Better Conversations sessions.

Also Known As
---------------
Effective Visual Aids, Optimized Flipchart Technique

Context
-------
This pattern is relevant in any online module where facilitators use flipcharts to capture ideas, illustrate concepts, or guide discussions.

Problem
-------
How to ensure that flipcharts are visible, legible, and contribute to a dynamic learning environment in a virtual setting.

Forces
------
*   Visibility and legibility for remote participants.
*   Minimizing cognitive load related to poor visual aids.
*   Enhancing engagement and creating a dynamic learning environment.

Solution
--------
Implement a series of proactive measures to optimize flipchart visibility, legibility, and content, combined with strategic use of Zoom features.

Implementation
----------------
1.  **Pre-Session Check:** Test the flipchart setup (lighting, camera angle, internet bandwidth).
2.  **High-Quality Markers:** Use thick, dark markers for visibility (Observation from CSV: "Beth needs thicker flipchart pens").
3.  **Large, Concise Writing:** Write clearly, using concise phrases (Observation from CSV: "The flipchart writing might be enhanced by being bigger and fewer words").
4.  **Strategic Content:** Plan content in advance, focusing on key concepts. Avoid overcrowding.
5.   **Spotlighting:** The producer spotlights the facilitator's video feed when they are actively using the flipchart so that is the largest image on the screen. This is especially important in virtual meetings.
6.  **Accessibility:** Repeat the content verbally and offer alternative formats (e.g., text summary in chat).
7.  **Flipchart as Guide:** Use the flipchart to structure the session, highlighting key points, and tracking progress.

Examples
--------
*   A facilitator tests the flipchart setup before the session and adjusts the lighting to minimize glare.
*   The producer monitors the chat for feedback on flipchart visibility and makes adjustments as needed.

Rationale
---------
Proactive flipchart management enhances participant understanding, reduces cognitive load, and creates a more engaging learning experience.
