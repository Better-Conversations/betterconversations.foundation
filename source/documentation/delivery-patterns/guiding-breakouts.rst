Guiding Breakouts
==================

.. tags:: safe, equal time, turn taking, respect, safety

Short Description
-----------------
Creating safety in the session by providing structure around the breakout room activity.

Also Known As
---------------
Creating equal opportunity, promoting safety, supporting time management

Context
-------
Applies to all modules of the Better Conversations course that incorporate breakout room activities, particularly when there is a likelihood of imbalanced participation.

Problem
-------
How to ensure that participants have equal opportunities in the limited time.

Solution
--------
Offer structures which help provide equal contribution.

Forces
------
*   Unequal Contribution: Some participants may naturally dominate discussions, while others may be hesitant to speak up.
*   Time Constraints: Breakout room activities are typically time-boxed, and imbalanced participation can prevent all participants from contributing.
*   Respect: You want to create a respectful environment.
*   Safety: Provide the level of safety required to support these patterns.
*   Facilitator skill: the facilitator should use their skills to ensure an environment of safety, and be aware of the tools such as time management they can use

Implementation
----------------
1.  **Structured Turn-Taking:** Provide clear guidelines for turn-taking within the breakout rooms (e.g., each person speaks for a set amount of time before passing it on).
2.  **Equal Time**: Provide clear guidelines for each participant to have equal time in the session.
3.  **Promote Listening:** Encourage participants to practice active listening and create space for quieter voices to be heard.
