Setting Up Breakout Rooms
=========================

.. tags:: pre-assign breakout rooms, production, logistics, zoom, efficiency

Short Description
-----------------
Preparing breakout rooms in advance to streamline the session start.

Also Known As
---------------
Prepared Breakouts, Advanced Breakout Room Setup

Context
-------
Applicable to all online modules of the Better Conversations course where you want the breakouts to be ready without consuming facilitation time.

Problem
-------
Setting up breakout rooms and assigning participants manually during a live session can take up valuable time and disrupt the flow, especially with larger groups.

Solution
--------
Utilize the pre-assign breakout rooms feature in Zoom (or your preferred platform) to configure breakout rooms and assign participants before the session begins.

Forces
------
*   Time Sensitivity: The session has a limited duration.
*   Seamless Flow: The creation of groups should not draw attention.
*   Attendee Preparation: People may be unfamiliar with who else is on the call.

Implementation
----------------
1.  **Attendee List:** Prepare a list of attendees and their email addresses.
2.  **Breakout Plan:** Decide on the desired breakout room configurations based on session activities.
3.  **Pre-Assignment:** Use Zoom's pre-assign feature to create the breakout rooms and assign participants using their email addresses.
4.  **Backup Plan:** Have a backup plan in case of late joiners or technical issues that prevent pre-assignment.

Examples
--------
* Observation from CSV: "Producer training: can set up BOR in pre-session and then assign people. This breaks down the learning."
* Observation from CSV: "People aren’t brought into breakout rooms “automatically” so do that instead of clicking “open room”."
* Observation from CSV: "Chandima couldn’t take a picture of the breakout rooms. When Simon looked that BORs I got only the ability to recreate"

Rationale
---------
Pre-assigning breakout rooms saves time and supports a smoother session, but may be confusing for those that join late.

Consequences

*   **Positive:** Minimizes disruption, promotes a professional image, and saves valuable session time.
*   **Negative:** Requires extra pre-session setup and a plan for unexpected changes.
