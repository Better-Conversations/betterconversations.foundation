.. tags:: single attendee, group size, facilitation, adaptation, personalization, engagement, online course

Short Description
-----------------
Adapting the Better Conversations course for sessions with only one participant to retain value and avoid an awkward situation.

Also Known As
---------------
Solo Delivery Adaptation, One-on-One Course Delivery

Context
-------
This pattern applies when only one participant joins a scheduled Better Conversations module, particularly in online deliveries.

Problem
-------
How to deliver a meaningful and engaging Better Conversations experience when only one participant attends a scheduled session designed for a group.

Solution
--------
Adapt the session to a personalized one-on-one conversation, with the facilitator acting as a partner and guide, and drawing in other resources as appropriate.

Forces
------
*   Loss of group discussion.
*   Continued time constraints.
*   Ensuring a worthwhile learning experience.
*   Preventing participant discomfort.
*   Facilitator unpreparedness.

Implementation
----------------
1.  **Acknowledge the Situation:** Acknowledge the small group size directly.
2.  **Adapt Exercises:** Convert group activities into one-on-one conversations.
3.  **Facilitator as Partner:** The facilitator shares their own experiences and insights.
4.  **Focus on Individual Needs:** Tailor the session to the participant's goals.
5.   **Go off-piste if needed**: It's okay to consult with the participant and explore topics beyond the course as they are interested.

Examples
--------
*   A facilitator adapts a breakout room exercise to a one-on-one discussion, using prompting and powerful questions.
*   An observer who joins on the call is invited to provide an additional view for the single participant.

Rationale
---------
This provides value to the participant
