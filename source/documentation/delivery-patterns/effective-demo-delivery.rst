Adaptive Demo Delivery
=======================

.. tags:: delivery, adaptation, experiment, delivery, improv, feedback

Short Description
-----------------
Adjusting the delivery of a demo based on real-time feedback and participant engagement to reinforce learning outcomes.

Also Known As
---------------
Responsive Demonstration, Flexible Example, Improvisational Demo

Context
-------
This pattern applies specifically to modules that incorporate demonstrations by the facilitators, such as Module 2 (Assumptions) and Module 4 (Listening with Curiosity).

Problem
-------
How to ensure a demo is effective and resonates with participants when real-time feedback indicates the initial approach is not working or is causing confusion.

Solution
--------
The facilitator constantly monitors the audience, questions the audience and has a series of different examples at different levels prepared to share.

Forces
------
*   Diverse Learning Styles: Participants learn in different ways.
*   Feedback from participants: The demonstration should be able to gather feedback from participants.

Implementation
----------------
1.  **Have a Plan A - and plan B and plan C**: Know what you want the demo to show before you start. Be prepared to throw it out the window.
2.  **Facilitator Awareness:** The facilitator delivering the demo must be highly attuned to participant cues (e.g., confused expressions, lack of engagement in chat) and be able to adapt accordingly.
3.  **Question and Adjust**: Where appropriate, the facilitator should ask a question to the audience and seek to work what what the demo is showing for them based on that.
4.  **Simplify the Questions:** Change or ask different questions if required.
5.   **Communicate.** Talk to other delivery members to assist

Examples
--------
*   Observation from CSV: "Christian missed a step in the demo - went straight to the questions. However he then asked some more questions to get back on track."
*   Observation from CSV: "On the assumptions exercise, Christine said it was easy to look after and she liked her plant - Does this help people?"
*   Observation from CSV: "Christian tried putting the questions up on a flipchart and pointing to them as he was doing the demo"

Rationale
---------
Meeting a group where they are ensures better value.

Consequences

*   **Positive:** Improved understanding for participants.
