============================

.. tags:: check list, communication, facilitation, preflight

Short Description
-----------------
The need for the facilitator and production team to have an awareness and regulation of their own state

Also Known As
---------------
Knowing when to stop, supporting cognitive loaf

Context
-------
For all facilitators at all times in all modules, to have an awareness of their own state, what they need to do, and not be afraid to ask for support

Problem
-------
If the facilitation team is overworked, in a poor state, then this will affect the quality of the delivery and be felt by the attendees.

Solution
--------
Build in a mechanism to allow each member of the facilitation team to state check.

Forces
------
*   State management
*   Clear team structure

Implementation
----------------
1.  **Preplan:** Test the flight plan and agree a strategy to account for what may arise.

2.  **Acknowledge** Make space to mention if there is anything pressing on your mind, or anything coming that may be an issue

3.   **Check in** Make sure that each person is comfortable to continue

4.   **Be aware of State levels:** Recognise when to ask for a time out

Examples
--------
* One facilitator had a difficult time at home, another co-facilitator took over
*   "Having two facilitators reduces cognitive load",

Rationale
---------
Increases team trust and enables better delivery.
