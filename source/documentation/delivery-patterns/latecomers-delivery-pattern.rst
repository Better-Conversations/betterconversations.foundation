Welcoming Latecomers
====================

.. tags:: welcome, latecomers, facilitation, production, zoom, participant experience, session flow, inclusivity

Short Description
---------------
Ensuring a smooth and welcoming experience for participants who arrive late to a Better Conversations session.

Also Known As
---------------
Welcoming Late Arrivals, Minimizing Disruption, Graceful Integration

Context
-------
This applies to all Better Conversations course deliveries.

Problem
-------
How to integrate participants who arrive late without disrupting the flow for those who arrived on time.

Forces
------
*   Respect for On-Time Participants
*   Welcoming Environment
*   Maintaining Session Flow

Solution
--------
1.  **Producer Greeting:** The producer privately welcomes latecomers via chat, acknowledging their arrival and providing brief instructions on how to catch up (e.g., "Welcome! We've just started the [activity]. You can find the materials in the chat.").
2.  **Brief Facilitator Acknowledgment:** At a natural break (e.g., after a breakout room activity), the facilitator briefly acknowledges the latecomers without disrupting the flow. Example: "Welcome to those who joined us recently. We're glad you're here!".
3.  **Individual Support:** During a break or quiet activity, the facilitator or producer privately offers individual support to latecomers, answering questions and providing a quick overview.
4.  **Leverage the Chat:** Direct latecomers to review the chat history for key information, instructions, and links.
5.  **(Optional) Buddy System:** Pair a latecomer with an on-time participant for peer support and guidance.

Examples
--------
*   Observation from CSV: "Guidance to facilitators for latecomers - Emma was late and we should make sure people feel welcome and supported"
*   Observation from CSV: "Document options when someone arrives late"

What it enables

*   Minimized disruption to the session flow.
*   Effective integration of latecomers.

What it inhibits
---------------
*   Potential for initial confusion for latecomers if instructions aren't clear.
*   Risk of taking up too much time if individual support isn't managed efficiently.

Facilitator considerations
--------------------------

*   Avoid singling out or embarrassing latecomers.
*   Focus on creating a welcoming and inclusive environment.

Producer considerations
-----------------------
*   Monitor participant arrivals and proactively welcome latecomers.
*   Provide clear and concise instructions in the private chat.
*   Ensure latecomers have access to all necessary materials.

Enabling actions
----------------
*   Create a template message for welcoming latecomers.
*   Designate a specific time for facilitator/producer check-in with late arrivals.

Disabling actions
----------------
*   Ignoring latecomers.
*   Publicly reprimanding latecomers.

Alternatives
------------
*   If many people are late, a very brief recap of the session so far could be useful if you have the space in the schedule.

Difficulties
------------
* Some latecomers may take longer to settle, particularly those without a familiarity with Zoom or the course format.
