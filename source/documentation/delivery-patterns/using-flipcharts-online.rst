Flipchart management is key to delivering Better Conversations online. We've refined our 
approach through extensive practice and feedback, ensuring that visual aids enhance rather 
than detract from the learning experience. This pattern helps maintain engagement and 
clarity in virtual environments where traditional in-person techniques need adaptation.

-----------------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`construction;1.8rem` Using this Pattern
-----------------------------------------------------------

Effective flipchart management is essential for:

- Maintaining participant engagement through clear visual aids
- Ensuring content visibility for all participants regardless of their setup
- Managing cognitive load in virtual environments
- Creating dynamic, interactive learning spaces online
- Supporting neurodiverse participants through clear, structured visual aids
- Reducing cognitive load through consistent presentation

Use this pattern when:

- Running any Better Conversations module that requires visual aids
- Facilitating group discussions that need visual capture
- Presenting complex concepts that benefit from visual representation

The drawbacks are that it requires careful preparation and technical setup, and
can be challenging to maintain consistency across different environments and
setups.

The alternative is to rely solely on digital slides or no visual aids, which
can reduce engagement and make it harder to capture emergent discussions and
ideas effectively.

-----------------------------------------------
:material-regular:`dashboard;1.8rem` Structure
-----------------------------------------------

The pattern consists of three main components:

- **Physical Setup**: Camera positioning, lighting, writing materials
- **Technical Integration**: Virtual platform features (spotlighting, chat)
- **Content Strategy**: Organization and presentation of visual information

Each component needs careful consideration and regular testing to ensure
effectiveness. This is particularly important for neurodiverse participants who
may have different visual processing needs or preferences.

-------------------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`groups;1.8rem` Roles and Responsibilities
-------------------------------------------------------------

**Facilitator(s):**

- Prepares and manages flipchart content
- Writes clearly and concisely
- Maintains engagement through visual aids

**Producer:**

- Manages technical aspects (spotlighting, zoom features)
- Monitors chat for visibility issues
- Coordinates with facilitator on timing

**Participants:**

- Provide feedback on visibility
- Engage with visual content
- Contribute to collaborative documentation

--------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`content_paste;1.8rem` Examples
--------------------------------------------------

**Example 1: Pre-session Setup**

- Test camera angle showing full flipchart
- Verify lighting eliminates glare
- Practice writing size and spacing
- Prepare key headers/frameworks in advance

**Example 2: During Session**

- Producer spotlights facilitator during flipchart use
- Facilitator verbalizes written content
- Chat used for accessibility support
- Regular checks for visibility

-------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`science;1.8rem` Testing
-------------------------------------------

We test effectiveness through:

- Pre-session technical checks
- Participant feedback on visibility
- Engagement metrics during sessions
- Post-session review of recordings
- Regular producer-facilitator debriefs

This allows us to continuously improve our approach and adapt to different
situations and participant needs.

----------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`touch_app;1.8rem` Implementation
----------------------------------------------------

1. **Physical Setup:**

- Position flipchart 45Â° to camera
- Use thick, dark markers (Note: "Beth needs thicker flipchart pens")
- Ensure consistent lighting
- Test visibility at different zoom levels
- Consider color contrast for visibility (avoid red/green combinations)
- Maintain consistent positioning to reduce visual tracking effort

2. **Content Management:**

- Plan key visual frameworks
- Use clear headers and structure
- Write large, clear text with fewer words (Based on feedback: "writing might be enhanced by being bigger and fewer words")
- Leave adequate white space
- Use flipchart to structure session flow and track progress
- Use consistent symbols and layouts across sessions
- Break information into clear, manageable chunks
- Avoid visual clutter or overwhelming patterns
- Consider offering digital copies of flipchart content after sessions

3. **Technical Integration:**

- Configure spotlight settings
- Set up backup capture methods
- Prepare alternative sharing options
- Test producer handoffs
- Provide alternative text-based formats in chat
- Allow participants to adjust their view as needed
- Consider recording key points in multiple formats (visual and text)

-------------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`sticky_note_2;1.8rem` Anything else
-------------------------------------------------------

Common challenges we've encountered:

- Managing glare and lighting changes
- Balancing detail vs. visibility
- Coordinating with producer for timing
- Handling technical difficulties
- Supporting participants with varying setups
- Supporting participants with different visual processing needs
- Balancing the needs of different learning styles
- Ensuring accessibility while maintaining engagement
