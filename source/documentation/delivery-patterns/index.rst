Delivery Patterns
=================

When we've delivered the course, we have made hundreds of observations about what 
works and what doesn't. We've distilled these observations into patterns that you might 
find useful in your own delivery of the course.

Delivery patterns are core, reusable solutions to common problems in the *delivery* of the 
Better Conversations course concerned mainly with facilitation, producer actions, managing flow.

On first glance, this might seem like unnecessary detail (after all, you may be an experience trainer). 
However, we believe that if we highlight the patterns that we have found useful, you will be able to 
make better informed decisions about what suits your audience and your context.

We continue to improve the course; if you have any suggestions for changes or
additional patterns, please let us know.
