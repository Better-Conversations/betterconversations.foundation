Flight plans are a structured approach to course delivery that ensures consistent, 
high-quality learning experiences. This pattern describes how we deliver the course 
using flight plans to support learning objectives, manage state, and enable 
continuous improvement.

   - as we do this more and more, we realise it doesn't matter what happened in the session
   - follow the patterns and it'll be fine 
   - we don't need to document every single thing that happens in the session

:material-outlined:`groups;1.8rem` Delivery roles
-------------------------------------------------

Currently, there are a number of roles described in the flight plans:

**Facilitators**: The people leading the session. We often have two 
facilitators to provide cover for each other, and to allow for the development
of new facilitators.

**Producers**: The people running the Zoom session, and who are 
responsible for the technical aspects of the session. If we have two producers, 
it is generally one lead and one trainee.

**Observers**: The people observing the session, usually in preparation for 
delivering the course, and/or training as a facilitator or producer.

**Participants**: The people who are attending the session.

**Sponsor**: Responsible for the outcomes of the session, in terms of 
"Why are we doing this?" and "What are we trying to achieve?". 

For the Foundation, the Sponsor is generally one of the directors or a 
Foundation Ambassador. When a course is delivered in a company it will 
be the person who comissioned the course, or their delegate. 

One thing we have learned is to be very aware of the role(s) we are in, and to
be clear about what we are doing in each moment and why. 

Of course, not all these roles will apply if you are delivering the session in
a different context. For example, if you are delivering a session to a small
group, you may not need two facilitators. If you are using the flight plans to
coach someone one-to-one, you will not need a producer. If you are delivering a
session to a very large group, you may need more than one producer.
