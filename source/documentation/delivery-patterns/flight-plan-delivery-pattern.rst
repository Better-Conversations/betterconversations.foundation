Using Flight Plans

Flight plans are a structured approach to course delivery that ensures consistent, 
high-quality learning experiences. This pattern describes how we deliver the course 
using flight plans to support learning objectives, manage state, and enable 
continuous improvement.

   - as we do this more and more, we realise it doesn't matter what happened in the session
   - follow the patterns and it'll be fine 
   - we don't need to document every single thing that happens in the session

:material-outlined:`groups;1.8rem` Delivery roles
-------------------------------------------------

The successful delivery of a flight plan requires clear role definition and coordination:

**Facilitators:**

Lead the learning experience through:

- Guiding participants through the learning journey
- Managing group dynamics and energy
- Adapting delivery to meet participant needs
- Ensuring learning objectives are met
- Providing feedback for continuous improvement

We often work with two facilitators to:
- Provide mutual support and coverage
- Enable development of new facilitators
- Offer different perspectives and styles
- Handle larger groups effectively

**Producers:**

Manage the technical environment to ensure smooth delivery:

- Running the virtual platform (e.g., Zoom)
- Managing breakout rooms and technical setup
- Supporting participants with technical issues
- Monitoring chat and engagement
- Coordinating with facilitators

**Observers:**

Support quality and development through:

- Documenting session delivery
- Providing structured feedback
- Learning delivery approaches
- Training for future roles
- Contributing to continuous improvement

**Participants:**

Active learners who:

- Engage in the learning experience
- Contribute to discussions and activities
- Provide feedback on their experience
- Apply learning in their context

**Sponsor:**

Provides strategic direction through:

- Setting session objectives and context
- Defining success criteria
- Supporting participant engagement
- Evaluating outcomes
- Providing organizational context

For information about the roles involved in designing flight plans, see the :ref:`flight-plan-design-pattern`.

One thing we have learned is to be very aware of the role(s) we are in, and to
be clear about what we are doing in each moment and why. 

Of course, not all these roles will apply if you are delivering the session in
a different context. For example, if you are delivering a session to a small
group, you may not need two facilitators. If you are using the flight plans to
coach someone one-to-one, you will not need a producer. If you are delivering a
session to a very large group, you may need more than one producer.

Execution process:
------------------

The delivery process follows three key phases:

1. **Pre-session coordination:**
   - Team preparation meetings
   - Resource and environment setup
   - Role clarity alignment

2. **During-session management:**
   - Following the structured timeline
   - Managing state and transitions
   - Adapting to group needs

3. **Post-session review:**
   - Collecting feedback
   - Documenting observations
   - Planning improvements
