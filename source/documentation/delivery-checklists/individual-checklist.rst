Individual Checklist
====================

This is what we expect the individual delivery team members to do 
before they join the session itself.

Since we first started running sessions, we've built an app (the Better Conversations Coordinator) to help us manage bookings, Zoom invite, emails and automate the selection of flight plans. It's not perfect, but it's a big help. 

You can find out more about the technical side of things here: :ref:`technical-stack`.
