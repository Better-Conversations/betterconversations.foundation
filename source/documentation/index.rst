If you're reading this, you're probably interested in learning how to
deliver the Better Conversations course. You'll find a lot of information
here, and we hope it's helpful. We've tried to keep it simple and easy to
refer back to. 

We do add content to this site regularly, so please check back often. If
you have any questions, please ask us.

About this section 
------------------

There are some technical terms and concepts in the course, but we've tried
to explain them as clearly as we can. If you're not sure about something,
please ask us or post a question in the Community forum.

We've tried to make the documentation as easy to use as we can. We've used
a consistent structure and layout, and we've included lots of links to
other parts of the documentation. We've also included a glossary of terms.

If you're new to the course, we recommend that you start with the Course
Overview. This will give you a good idea of what the course is about and
how it's structured.

For those of you who have been on the course, you might want to start with
the `Flight Plans </documentation/course-materials/flight_plans.html>`_.
These are the detailed plans for each session, and they include all the
information you need to deliver each module, along with the Course
Handbook.

Note that for some of the content you'll need to sign in with your email
address.
