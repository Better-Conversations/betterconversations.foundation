If you're reading this, you're probably interested in learning how to
deliver the Better Conversations course. You'll find a lot of information
here, and we hope it's helpful. We've tried to keep it simple and easy to
refer back to.

Please note that:

- We do add content to this site regularly, so please check back often. 
- You may need to sign in with your email address for some content.

- There are some technical terms and concepts in the course. We've tried 
  to explain them as clearly as we can. If you're not sure about something, 
  or can't find what you're looking for, please ask us or post a question in the
  `Community forum <https://community.betterconversations.foundation>`_.

- If you're new to the course, we recommend that you start with the 
  `Course Overview <https://betterconversations.foundation/l/overview>`_. 
  This will  give you a good idea of what the course is about and how it's 
  structured.

- For those of you who have been on the course, you might want to go straight to
  the `Flight Plans <https://betterconversations.foundation/l/flightplans>`_. 
  These are the detailed plans for each session, and they include all the 
  information you need to deliver each module, along with the Course Handbook.
