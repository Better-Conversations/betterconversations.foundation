# LinkedIn Certifications/Badges

The Foundation is able to issue badges to participants who have completed the course.

You can see an example on [Chandima's LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chandimadutton/) which looks like this:

## Badges we issue

Currently we issue two badges:

- Better Conversations Attendee 
- Better Conversations Faculty

The Attendee badge is issued to participants who have completed the course with the Foundation or an approved partner.

The Faculty badge is issued to facilitators who have completed the course with the Foundation and have delivered
the course on behalf of the Foundation in the past 12 months. 

## Who can issue badges

Attendee badges can be issued by:

- The Foundation
- Foundation Faculty approved by the Foundation
- Faculty members of government-recognised or accredited institutions, as approved by the Foundation

Note that the Foundation reserves the right to withdraw approval for any of the above at any time.

## Badge Issuance

We have automated the issuance of badges to attendees and facilitators. If you are an approved issuer, you can issue badges via the Badge Issuance System in the coordinator.

## PDF Certificates

We use [Open Badge Factory](https://openbadgefactory.com/en/) to issue the badges, and they also 
offer a PDF download for people who would like to print their badge and frame it.
