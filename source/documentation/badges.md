# LinkedIn Certifications/Badges

The Foundation is able to issue badges to participants who have completed the course.

You can see an example on [Chandima's LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chandimadutton/) which looks like this:

## Badges we issue

Currently we issue two badges:

- Better Conversations Attendee 
- Better Conversations Faculty

The Attendee badge is issued to participants who have completed the course with the Foundation or an approved partner.

The Faculty badge is issued to facilitators who have completed the course with the Foundation and have delivered
the course on behalf of the Foundation in the past 6 months. 

## Who can issue badges

Attendee badges can be issued by:

- The Foundation
- Foundation Faculty approved by the Foundation
- Faculty members of government-recognised or accredited institutions, as approved by the Foundation

Note that the Foundation reserves the right to withdraw approval for any of the above at any time.

Whilst we don't mind what you call your course, you must give "Better Conversations" as defined 
[here](/work-with-us/course-definition) which 
includes following the flight plans, and delivering at least modules 1-5.


## Badge Issuance

We have automated the issuance of badges to attendees and facilitators. If you are an approved issuer, you can issue badges via the Badge Issuance System in the coordinator. You will get a URL which you can share with participants:

- They will be asked to confirm that they have completed the course
- They will be asked to complete a brief survey
- They will be asked to provide their name and email address (preferably the same as their LinkedIn profile)
- And finally they agree to the terms of use (which is basically they give us their permission to issue the badge)


The proposer will then get a confirmation email, once they've confirmed they've attended the course, we'll issue the badge. They will then get an email from Open Badge Factory with instrucctions on how to claim their badge.


## PDF Certificates

We use [Open Badge Factory](https://openbadgefactory.com/en/) to issue the badges, and they also 
offer a PDF download for people who would like to print their badge and frame it.
