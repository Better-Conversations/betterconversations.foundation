# Assumptions

We are assuming that you are familiar with the course and have been on it yourself. If you haven't, we recommend that you do so before you start using these materials. 

You don't need to be a professional facilitator to use these materials, but you do need to be comfortable with the idea of facilitating a group of people. You don't need to be a technical whizz either, but you do need to be comfortable using a computer and the internet, software like Zoom and Microsoft Word.

Finally, we've described the course as we have developed and delivered it. For example, we use Zoom for the online sessions, and we use Microsoft Word for the course materials. You might want to use different tools, and that's fine. We've tried to make the materials as flexible as we can, so you can adapt them to your own needs. We usually deliver the course in English, but you might want to deliver it in another language. Again, that's fine. We've tried to explain things in a way that's easy to translate. We usually deliver the course over five 1-hour online modules (with an optional 6th module) across several weeks, but you might want to deliver it in a different way.
