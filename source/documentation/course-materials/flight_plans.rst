Flight Plans
============

Designed to be used by the course delivery team, our "Flight Plans" are the detailed 
instructions for running the course. We use them every time we run the course and
consider them to be the most important part of the material we are making available.

We are also constantly improving them based on feedback from the course delivery teams.
You'll see that the flight plans are versioned. You can find the change log at the bottom
of this page. 

Don't feel you need to update to every version. Check the change notes to see
if you want to update your version. Most of the time the changes are small and
we hope helpful.

If you're delivering a course for the Foundation you'll be using the latest versions
of the flight plans.

Using the Flight Plans
----------------------

We distribute the flight plans as PDFs. If you want to edit them you can just open 
the PDF in Word.

The Foundation has historically used Word files stored on Sharepoint, which allows
the delivery team to all work off the same copy. We are phasing this out and moving
to the Delivery Console.
