The flight plans we publish refer to flipcharts that are used to present agendas,topics and capture the discussion. 

If you are running a course for the Foundation you'll be using the latest versions of the flight plans and flipcharts. 

The latest version of the example flipcharts are available as a pdf download `here <current-flipcharts_>`_.

Please get in touch with us if you need a copy of the flipcharts in another format.
