We have prepared a handbook for participants which you can download
as a PDF `here <current-handbook_>`_. 
It contains information about the course and also the material that's
taught. 

If you would like this branded with your logos etc. do get in touch. 
Similarly if you want just a section of this with a specific model we
can do this for you.
