:material-outlined:`construction;1.8rem` Using this pattern
-----------------------------------------------------------

This pattern addresses these challenges:

- How to define clear responsibilities across the design team
- How to ensure effective collaboration
- When and how to transition work between different roles
- How to maintain consistency in course materials and delivery
- How to scale the team structure for different course sizes
- How to ensure quality across all course components
- How to align course design with organizational goals and participant needs

------------------------------------------------   
:material-outlined:`groups;1.8rem` Design roles
------------------------------------------------

Each role may be performed by a single person or shared across a team, depending on the context. Note that some of these roles also appear in the :ref:`roles-delivery-pattern`.

Sponsor
-------

Understanding the Sponsor's role is key to designing and adapting courses that 
meet organizational needs.

The Sponsor represents the stakeholder(s) commissioning the course delivery. 
This can be:

- An organization funding the training
- A department within a larger organization
- Multiple stakeholders with shared interests

Key responsibilities include:

- Strategic oversight and funding
- Defining business outcomes and success metrics
- Setting organizational constraints (budget, timeline, participant numbers)
- Approving course design and delivery approach
- Providing domain expertise and context
- Ensuring alignment with organizational goals

In larger organizations, Sponsors often delegate operational responsibilities to a designated manager (the Client) who:

- Acts as the primary point of contact
- Coordinates logistics and scheduling
- Manages participant enrollment
- Provides ongoing feedback
- Ensures delivery meets organizational needs

Course Designer
---------------

The Course Designer shapes the learning journey by crafting an effective and 
engaging experience that meets both participant needs and organizational goals.
Their responsibilities include:

- Defining clear learning objectives and outcomes
- Selecting and sequencing appropriate design patterns
- Creating a coherent learning journey that builds progressively
- Establishing measurable success criteria

The Designer ensures effective learning through careful attention to:

- Active participation strategies
- Clear and concise instructions
- Appropriate session pacing
- Checking for understanding
- Meaningful practice opportunities
- Regular reflection points

Our courses are designed to be experiential, with opportunities for participants to apply what they've learned in the course. We don't formally assess participants, but we do check for understanding throughout the course. Educators who want to include assessment might consider adding activities around each session, or extening the length of the sessions to allow for more time for reflection and application.

Content Developer
-----------------

The Content Developer brings the course design to life by creating and maintaining the materials that support the learning experience. Their responsibilities include:

- Creating learning materials and activities
- Writing instructions and guides
- Developing supporting resources
- Ensuring consistency across materials
- Maintaining content quality
- Reviewing pattern implementations
- Validating learning approaches

Common variations
-----------------

Templates and materials
-----------------------
We have prepared a range of templates and materials to support the design process. These are available in the :ref:`course-materials` section.

In particular, :ref:`course_overview` is a useful template for the Course Designer to record the learning objectives, design patterns, and other relevant information.


------------------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`touch_app;1.8rem` Setup and requirements
------------------------------------------------------------

We share all our templates and materials under a Creative Commons license so you don't need to start from scratch. These are available in the :ref:`course-materials` section. 

We suggest that any adaptations you might make are tracked to ensure that any future updates from us can be applied easily.

Our Community is a great place to ask questions and share your learning with others. You automatically get access to the Community when you attend our Experience courses.

:material-outlined:`sticky_note_2;1.8rem` Additional design factors
-------------------------------------------------------------------  

Implementation considerations
-----------------------------

Piloting and initial design and rollout of the course to a small group needs a smaller team where roles may be shared. This enables the team to focus on learning and adapting the course design.

Large scale rollouts will need to consider how the content is adapted to local contexts, including languages.

More experienced facilitators might advise on content development to ensure that the materials are of a high quality and consistent with the course design. We have some highly skilled facilitators in our Community who support and help develop the course materials.

We have found it useful to clarify who is responsible for different elements of the course design and delivery. Ambiguous roles can lead to confusion and delays in the design process, and less effective conversations (which can be frustrating for everyone). It is especially important to talk about who is responsible for things like final sign off on the course materials.

Design evolution
----------------

As the course evolves, and it is used in different contexts, we may need to revisit design roles and responsibilities. Please let us know if you have any feedback or suggestions for improvement.
