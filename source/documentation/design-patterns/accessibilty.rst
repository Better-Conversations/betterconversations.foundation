.. tags:: accessibility, welcoming, chat, connection, access

Short Description
-----------------
Considering accessiblity factors when designing an activity.

Also Known As
---------------
Accessiblity adjustments

Context
-------
This pattern is most useful at the start of any module where you want to be respectful and welcome to everyone who joins the session.

Problem
-------
How to cater for potential accessiblity limitations of attendees.

Solution
--------
Create a habit of building alternative methods of access into the session

Forces
------
*   Recognising participant challenges
*   Ensuring the design is open to all

Implementation
----------------
1.  **Be Inclusive:** Don't make assumptions that everything will work
2.  **Consider different modes of access:** Consider alternative means to communicate. Use large text, read out items.
3.  **Offer Choice:** Give participants a choice of what they can do.

Examples
--------
People joining on an iPad have chat view

*   Observation from CSV: "People with cameras off - hard to know if they are engaging "
*  Observation from CSV: "Ieva said the same thing, it was useful for her and Simina to do it together and can use this knowledge and incorporate it into their work life."

Rationale
---------
Participants may otherwise be excluded.
