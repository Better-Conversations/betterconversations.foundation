      Mainly this is a general discussion of how/why we use flipcharts. 
      The detailed examples should be versioned along with the flight plans

      Note that the facilitator standing up and writing on the flipchart means

      - They can put more energy into the group just by standing up and moving
      - They can control the pace of the group by writing slowly or quickly
      - They can let someone know their contribution has been heard by writing it down, 
        and it is time to stop by turning around and putting the cap on their pen
