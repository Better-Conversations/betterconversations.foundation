Design Patterns
===============

As we develop this course, we spot things that are helpful to know. We call
these "design patterns", a term borrowed from the world of software.

You might be wondering why we're sharing these design patterns. We want to be
transparent about how we've designed the course, and to help you understand why
we have made certain decisions about the way we deliver the course. We also
want to encourage you to think about how you might design your own courses. You
can reuse these patterns, or adapt them to your own needs.

On first glance, this might seem like unnecessary detail. However, we believe
that when you deliver the course yourself, you will be able to make better
informed decisions about what suits your audience and your context.

We continue to improve the course; if you have any suggestions for changes or
additional patterns, please let us know.
