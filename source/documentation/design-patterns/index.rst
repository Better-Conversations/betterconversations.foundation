Design Patterns
===============

As we develop this course, we spot things that are helpful to know. We call
these "design patterns", a term borrowed from the world of software.

Design patterns are core, reusable solutions to common problems in the design of the 
Better Conversations course concerned mainly with course structure, content, learning 
activities.

You might be wondering why we're sharing these design patterns. We want to be
transparent about how we've designed the course, and to help you understand why
we have made certain decisions about the way we deliver the course. We also
want to encourage you to think about how you might design your own courses. You
can reuse these patterns, or adapt them to your own needs.

We continue to improve the course; if you have any suggestions for changes or
additional patterns, please let us know.
