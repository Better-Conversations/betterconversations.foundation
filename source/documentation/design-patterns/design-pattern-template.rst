Design Pattern Template 
========================= 

Add an introduction to the pattern here. This should explain:

- What this pattern contributes to course design
- How it enhances learning outcomes
- Which learning objectives it supports
- Any alternative names for the pattern

-----------------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`construction;1.8rem` Using this pattern
-----------------------------------------------------------

Explain when and why to use this pattern in course design:

- Which learning challenges does it address?
- How does it support specific course objectives?
- What learning outcomes does it enable?
- What are the pedagogical considerations?
- What alternative approaches might be considered?

-----------------------------------------------------  
:material-outlined:`architecture;1.8rem` Architecture
-----------------------------------------------------

Describe the core structure and components:

- What are the essential elements?
- How do components relate?
- What variations are possible?
- What are the key design principles?
- How does it integrate with other patterns?

-----------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`groups;1.8rem` Design roles
-----------------------------------------------

These roles may be held by the same person or split across a team. The key is ensuring all these responsibilities are covered.

**Course Designer:**

- Defines learning objectives and outcomes
- Selects and sequences patterns
- Plans assessment strategy
- Determines success criteria
- Makes high-level structure decisions
- Ensures alignment with learning goals
- Ensures effective learning approaches:
  - Active participation
  - Clear instructions
  - Appropriate pacing
  - Knowledge checks
  - Practice opportunities
- Reviews and improves the pattern based on feedback
- Maintains design standards

**Content Developer:**

- Creates learning materials and activities
- Writes instructions and guides
- Develops supporting resources
- Ensures consistency across materials
- Implements quality standards
- Maintains content accuracy
- Reviews pattern implementations
- Validates learning approaches
- Coordinates with other courses
