Writing a Design Pattern
========================

.. note::
   Design patterns are core, reusable solutions to common problems in the design of the Better Conversations course concerned mainly with course structure, content, and learning activities.
   
   This section gives some guidance on how to write a design pattern for this site. It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to design patterns, but will give you a starting point. In each section below, choose what is relevant to your pattern and replace the text. You don't have to use all the suggested sections, but it is important that you include all the sections that are relevant to your pattern.

   Name the pattern with a short title (verb-noun format is useful)

-----------------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`construction;1.8rem` Using this pattern
-----------------------------------------------------------

Explain the pattern's purpose and value:

- What does it contribute to course design?
- When should it be used?
- What challenges does it address?
- What are the key benefits?
- What alternatives might be considered?

--------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`design_services;1.8rem` Form
--------------------------------------

Describe the pattern's structure:

- Key components and their relationships
- Variations and adaptations
- Integration with other patterns

-----------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`groups;1.8rem` Design roles
-----------------------------------------------

Outline the key roles involved in the design process:

- Responsibilities for each role
- Collaboration points

Note that the design process is iterative and that the roles may overlap.

-----------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`sync;1.8rem` Improvement Process
-----------------------------------------------------

**Continuous Improvement Cycle:**

1. **Collect & Analyze**

   - Use structured observation templates
   - Gather implementation data
   - Identify recurring issues
   - Map dependencies

2. **Plan & Prioritize**

   - Evaluate impact vs effort
   - Set implementation roadmap
   - Allocate resources

3. **Implement & Validate**

   - Test changes in controlled environment
   - Document outcomes
   - Share results
