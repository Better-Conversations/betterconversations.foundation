Writing a Design Pattern
========================

.. note::
   Design patterns are core, reusable solutions to common problems in the design of the Better Conversations course concerned mainly with course structure, content, and learning activities.
   
   This section gives some guidance on how to write a design pattern for this site. It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to design patterns, but will give you a starting point. In each section below, choose what is relevant to your pattern and replace the text. You don't have to use all the suggested sections, but it is important that you include all the sections that are relevant to your pattern.

   Name the pattern with a short title (verb-noun format is useful)

-----------------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`construction;1.8rem` Using this pattern
-----------------------------------------------------------

Explain the pattern's purpose and value:

- What does it contribute to course design?
- When should it be used?
- What challenges does it address?
- What are the key benefits?
- What alternatives might be considered?

--------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`design_services;1.8rem` Form
--------------------------------------

Describe the pattern's structure:

- What are the key components and their relationships?
- What are the variations and adaptations?
- What are the integration with other patterns?

-----------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`groups;1.8rem` Design roles
-----------------------------------------------

Outline the key roles involved in the design process:

- What are the responsibilities for each role?
- What are the collaboration points?

Note that the design process is iterative and that the roles may overlap.

----------------------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`content_paste;1.8rem` Examples and resources
----------------------------------------------------------------

Provide concrete examples, including what has been learned from applying it within different contexts.

**Practical Examples:**

- What are some real-world applications?
- What are some case studies?
- What are some lessons learned?

**Templates & Materials:**

- What are some implementation checklists?
- What are some observation forms?
- What are some feedback collection tools?

**Reference Materials:**

- What are some sample completed patterns?
- What are some best practice guides?
- What are some design process documentation?

----------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`touch_app;1.8rem` Implementation
----------------------------------------------------

**Setup & Requirements:**

- What are the minimum requirements?
- What are the preparation steps?
- What are the resource needs?

**Execution:**

- What are the key actions?
- What are the timing considerations?
- What are the troubleshooting steps?

**Evaluation:**

- What are the success indicators?
- What are some common challenges and pitfalls?
- What are some feedback mechanisms?

-------------------------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`sticky_note_2;1.8rem` Additional design factors
-------------------------------------------------------------------  

**Implementation Considerations:**

- What are the trade-offs and compromises?
- What are the constraints and limitations?
- What are the dependencies and requirements?
- What are the risks and mitigation strategies?
- What are the opportunities for enhancement?

**Design Evolution:**

- What are the potential future developments?
- What are the scalability considerations?
- What are the adaptation possibilities?
- What are the integration opportunities?
- What are the maintenance requirements?

-----------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`sync;1.8rem` Improvement process
-----------------------------------------------------

**Continuous Improvement Cycle:**

1. **Collect & Analyze**

   - Use structured observation templates
   - Gather implementation data
   - Identify recurring issues
   - Map dependencies

2. **Plan & Prioritize**

   - Evaluate impact vs effort
   - Set implementation roadmap
   - Allocate resources

3. **Implement & Validate**

   - Test changes in controlled environment
   - Document outcomes
   - Share results
