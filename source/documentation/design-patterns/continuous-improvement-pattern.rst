    This pattern is under development.

-----------------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`construction;1.8rem` Using this pattern
-----------------------------------------------------------

This pattern describes the continuous improvement process for systematic refinement of course design and delivery methods. It is based on the PDCA cycle (Plan, Do, Check, Act). PDCA is a framework for continuous improvement that is used in many industries, including manufacturing, software development, and project management. It process for continuous improvement and a core part of our approach to Better Conversations.

The CI process connects design and delivery patterns and improvements through structured observation and feedback. It covers how design changes feed into delivery and how delivery insights inform design.

The continuous improvement process follows a structured process as follows:

Plan
----

This stage establishes the baseline :ref:`course-materials`, :ref:`design-patterns` and :ref:`delivery-patterns` to capture the key elements of the course.

Do
--

This stage is about delivering the course and collecting observations. There are three key activities:

- **Briefing the session** where the delivery team meets to prepare for the session, including discussing the flight plan, agreeing roles and performing equipment checks.   
- **Delivering the session and collecting session observations** where the module content is delivered and the session observations are collected. We also capture and feedback from participants.
- **Debriefing the session** where the delivery team reviews the session, including sharing observations about what went well and what could be improved. feedback from the delivery team is also added to the session observations.

The :ref:`delivery-patterns` describe important aspects of delivery. In addition, we have gathered some tips for delivering the course in the :ref:`delivery-guidance` section.

Check
-----

The check stage is about reviewing the observations and deciding what to do next.

- **Categorise observations** Given the number of observations that we collect, it is helpful to categorise and tag them so we can better understand the patterns and trends, and decide which aspects to focus on.
- **Review observations** to understand the patterns and trends across the observation dataset. Sometimes there may be conflicting observations, due to different perspectives or interpretations. We will document any relevant variations or alternative approaches in the pattern documentation and delivery guidance.
- **Prioritise updates** based on the importance of the observations and the impact of the changes. Some observations can be addressed immediately, while others may be part of a longer-term plan or need further evidence or research before we can make changes.

Act
---

The act stage is about making and testing changes and communicating the updates.

- **Update course materials** We will make major and minor updates to the course materials, patterns and guidance based on the observations and feedback. Note that we will test significant updates before releasing a new version.
- **Release new version** A new version of the course materials, patterns and guidance is released after testing.
- **Communicate changes** to the Faculty and our community. We will also update this website for the latest release of course materials, patterns and guidance.


The PDCA stages are iterative and we will repeat the approach as part of our continuous improvement process.

-----------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`groups;1.8rem` Design roles
-----------------------------------------------

The following roles are involved in the continuous improvement process:

- **Delivery Team:** This includes facilitators, producers, observers and sponsors and anyone training in those roles in the sessions.
- **Course Designers:** Creates the learning journey
- **Content Developer:** Develops and maintains materials


----------------------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`content_paste;1.8rem` Examples and resources
----------------------------------------------------------------

Common variations
-----------------

- **Rapid iteration cycles for urgent issues** These are needed for urgent issues that need to be addressed. We may need to update the flight plans during the session briefing and make changes to the master versions of the flight plans later.
- **Periodic comprehensive reviews** We will review the course materials and patterns to ensure they are up to date and aligned with the latest research and practice.
- **Continuous small enhancements** We will make small changes to the course materials and patterns to improve the learning experience.   
- **Major version updates** Sometimes, we may need to make significant changes to the course materials and patterns to address new research or practice. We will communicate the likely changes in advance to our Faculty and Community to allow them to prepare for the changes.

Examples and resources
-----------------------

We use project management tools to help us manage the continuous improvement process. Examples of tools we use or have used include:

- `Linear <https://linear.app>`_
- `Trello <https://trello.com>`_
- `Notion <https://notion.so>`_
- `Jira <https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira>`_

Howver, it is not necessary to use specialist software to manage the CI process. When we piloted the course we used standard word processing documents and/or spreadsheets such as Microsoft Word and Excel or Google Docs and Sheets. We moved to more sophisticated tools as we scaled up to deliver more sessions.
