===========================
Continuous Improvement (CI)
===========================

.. warning::

    This pattern is under development.

.. note::
    This pattern describes the continuous improvement process that links design and delivery patterns, ensuring systematic evolution of both course design and delivery methods.

-----------------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`construction;1.8rem` Using this pattern
-----------------------------------------------------------

The CI process connects design and delivery improvements through structured observation and feedback:

- What feedback loops exist between design and delivery?
- How do design changes impact delivery?
- How do delivery insights inform design?
- When should improvements be made?
- How are improvements prioritized?

See :ref:`observations-design-pattern` and :ref:`observations-delivery-pattern` for detailed guidance on collecting observations.

--------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`sync;1.8rem` Process
--------------------------------------

**1. Collect & Analyze**

Uses :ref:`observations-delivery-pattern` to:

- Collect session observations
- Gather participant feedback
- Record technical metrics
- Document delivery variations

Uses :ref:`observations-design-pattern` to:

- Analyze patterns across sessions
- Identify recurring issues
- Map dependencies
- Evaluate effectiveness

**2. Plan & Prioritize**

- How are improvements evaluated?
- What criteria determine priorities?
- How are resources allocated?
- When are changes implemented?

**3. Design Updates**

Follows :ref:`observations-design-pattern` to:

- Document design changes
- Track pattern evolution
- Manage dependencies
- Validate modifications

**4. Delivery Updates**

Uses :ref:`observations-delivery-pattern` to:

- Document delivery changes
- Track implementation
- Measure effectiveness
- Share learnings

**5. Validate & Share**

Combines both observation patterns to:

- Test improvements
- Measure success
- Document outcomes
- Share results
