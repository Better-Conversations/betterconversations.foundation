Working with Flipcharts
=======================

Flipcharts are a core tool in Better Conversations course design. They provide a 
structured way to support learning objectives while maintaining engagement and 
creating shared understanding.

:material-outlined:`construction;1.8rem` Using this Pattern
-----------------------------------------------------------

Flipcharts are essential for:

- Supporting different learning styles
- Building collective memory during sessions
- Creating shared visual understanding
- Enabling emergent learning capture
- Supporting course structure flexibility
- Reinforcing key learning points

The drawbacks are that they require more skill than slides and can be less 
polished than digital alternatives.

Flipcharts serve several key learning functions:

- **Visual Learning**: Supporting visual learners
- **Group Memory**: Creating lasting learning artifacts
- **Emergent Capture**: Allowing for dynamic content creation
- **Learning Reinforcement**: Making key points visible
- **Engagement Support**: Enabling active participation

-------------------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`groups;1.8rem` Roles and Responsibilities
-------------------------------------------------------------

**Course Designer:**

- Plans key visual frameworks
- Identifies critical capture points
- Designs for visual learning
- Structures content for flipchart use

**Participants:**

- Engage with visual content
- Build shared understanding
- Create collective memory
- Reference learning points

--------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`content_paste;1.8rem` Examples
--------------------------------------------------

**Learning Support:**

- Key frameworks captured visually
- Important concepts illustrated
- Group insights documented
- Learning progress tracked

**Course Structure:**

- Session outlines visible
- Learning objectives displayed
- Key questions captured
- Group agreements recorded

-------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`science;1.8rem` Testing
-------------------------------------------

Effectiveness measured through:

- Learning retention rates
- Participant understanding
- Knowledge transfer success
- Group learning outcomes

----------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------

Course design considerations:

1. **Learning Integration:**
   - Plan key visual frameworks
   - Identify capture moments
   - Design for visual learning
   - Structure content flow

2. **Content Planning:**
   - Prepare key frameworks
   - Design visual structures
   - Plan capture points
   - Consider learning progression

      Mainly this is a general discussion of how/why we use flipcharts. 
      The detailed examples should be versioned along with the flight plans

      Note that the facilitator standing up and writing on the flipchart means

      - They can put more energy into the group just by standing up and moving
      - They can control the pace of the group by writing slowly or quickly
      - They can let someone know their contribution has been heard by writing it down, 
        and it is time to stop by turning around and putting the cap on their pen
