Writing a Design Pattern
========================

.. note::
   Design patterns are core, reusable solutions to common problems in the design of the Better Conversations course concerned mainly with course structure, content, and learning activities.
   
   This section gives some guidance on how to write a design pattern for this site. It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to design patterns, but will give you a starting point. In each section below, choose what is relevant to your pattern and replace the text. You don't have to use all the suggested sections, but it is important that you include all the sections that are relevant to your pattern.

   Name the pattern with a short title (verb-noun format is useful)

-----------------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`construction;1.8rem` Using this pattern
-----------------------------------------------------------

Explain the pattern's purpose and value:

- What does it contribute to course design?
- When should it be used?
- What challenges does it address?
- What are the key benefits?
- What alternatives might be considered?

------------------------------------------------   
:material-outlined:`design_services;1.8rem` Form
------------------------------------------------

Describe the pattern's structure:

- What are the key components and their relationships?
- What are the variations and adaptations?
- What are the integration with other patterns?

-----------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`groups;1.8rem` Design roles
-----------------------------------------------

Outline the key roles involved in the design process:

- What are the responsibilities for each role?
- What are the collaboration points?

Note that the design process is iterative and that the roles may overlap.

----------------------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`content_paste;1.8rem` Examples and resources
----------------------------------------------------------------

Provide practical design adaptations that have been learned from applying it within different contexts. Consider the following:

Common variations
-----------------

- What are some different timings that have been used?
- What happens if you use different technologies?
- What different audiences have been considered?

Templates and materials
-----------------------

- What session templates are there?
- What delivery guides are there?
- What checklists are there?
- What participant materials are there?
- What observation forms are there?
- What feedback collection tools are there?

Practical examples
------------------

- What real-world applications have led to improved designs?
- What are some lessons learned specific to design?

------------------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`touch_app;1.8rem` Setup and requirements
------------------------------------------------------------

- What minimum requirements are there?
- What preparation is needed?
- What resources are needed?

-------------------------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`sticky_note_2;1.8rem` Additional design factors
-------------------------------------------------------------------  

Implementation considerations
-----------------------------

- What are the trade-offs and compromises?
- What are the scalability considerations?
- What are the constraints and limitations?
- What are the dependencies and requirements?
- What are the risks and mitigation strategies?
- What are the opportunities for enhancement?

Design evolution
----------------

- What are the potential future developments?
- What are the adaptation possibilities?
- What are the integration opportunities?
- What are the maintenance requirements?

----------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`sync;1.8rem` Improvement process
----------------------------------------------------

Consider the following process for improving the pattern:

1. **Collect and analyze**

   - Use structured observation templates
   - Gather implementation data
   - Identify recurring issues
   - Map dependencies

2. **Plan and prioritize**

   - Evaluate impact vs effort
   - Set implementation roadmap
   - Allocate resources

3. **Implement and validate**

   - Test changes in a controlled environment
   - Document outcomes
   - Share results

.. to do::

   TODO Compare this to the continuous improvement pattern.
