=========================================

.. tags:: check list, communication, training, team, trust, responsibility

Short Description
-----------------
Clearly defining roles for all involved parties to ensure everyone is effective in their goals.

Also Known As
---------------
Defined role dynamics, well managed delivery

Context
-------
For all facilitators at all times, this sets the overall goals of the course that must be handled within the time of the meeting.

Problem
-------
If the facilitator and producer roles are ambiguous, then the value of the session may be at risk and important actions might not be undertaken.

Solution
--------
There must be defined roles and responsibilities, that are understood and shared to maximise value.

Forces
------
*   Efficient use of expertise, it enables better decision-making.
*   It must allow a well supported session, that is designed to meet the training needs of all present.

Implementation
----------------
1.  **Discuss Roles**: Ensure time is put in to discuss which person has each area of responsibility to share information
2.  **Clear Roles**: There are many elements - for instance, chat view, or time keeper - so assign clear owners to those responsibilities.
3.  **Clear Handovers:** Have defined handover times, which can be updated in person.

Examples
--------
* One facilitator can ask for questions from the breakout rooms, then the producer can answer that.

Rationale
---------
The whole flight plan relies on having specific and well-defined roles.
