Accessibility design ensures our courses are welcoming and effective for all participants. 
This pattern describes how we design for diverse needs from the start, rather than 
retrofitting accommodations later.

-----------------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`construction;1.8rem` Using this pattern
-----------------------------------------------------------

This pattern addresses these learning challenges:

- How to support diverse participant needs
- When to provide alternative access methods
- How to maintain engagement across differences
- Ways to ensure inclusive participation
- Methods for adapting delivery

The pattern is particularly valuable when:

- Context
- -------
- This pattern is most useful at the start of any module where you want to be respectful and welcome to everyone who joins the session.
- 
- Problem
- -------
- How to cater for potential accessiblity limitations of attendees.
- 
- Solution
- --------
- Create a habit of building alternative methods of access into the session
- 
- Forces
- ------
- *   Recognising participant challenges
- *   Ensuring the design is open to all
- 
- Implementation
- ----------------
- 1.  **Be Inclusive:** Don't make assumptions that everything will work
- 2.  **Consider different modes of access:** Consider alternative means to communicate. Use large text, read out items.
- 3.  **Offer Choice:** Give participants a choice of what they can do.
- 
- Examples
- --------
- People joining on an iPad have chat view
- 
- *   Observation from CSV: "People with cameras off - hard to know if they are engaging "
- *  Observation from CSV: "Ieva said the same thing, it was useful for her and Simina to do it together and can use this knowledge and incorporate it into their work life."
- 
- Rationale
- ---------
- Participants may otherwise be excluded.
