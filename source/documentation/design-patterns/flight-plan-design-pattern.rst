:material-outlined:`construction;1.8rem` Using this pattern
-----------------------------------------------------------

Flight plans are a structured approach to course design that ensures consistent,
high-quality learning experiences. At its core, a flight plan serves as both a
delivery framework and a state management tool for the delivery team, providing
detailed structure while maintaining flexibility for different contexts.

We believe in transparency and shared learning and publish our flight plans 
openly so others can benefit from our work and see how we're evolving our 
practice. This transparency also ensures that when you partner with us for 
Experience Courses, you know exactly what to expect – our sessions run according to these published plans.

A flight plan serves as both a delivery framework and a state management tool, 
helping the delivery team to:

- Provide a detailed framework for session delivery
- Ensure comprehensive coverage of learning objectives
- Create a solid foundation for continuous improvement

This pattern specifically addresses challenges in how to:

- Balance structure with flexibility in delivery
- Support effective team coordination
- Scale delivery while maintaining quality
- Manage people's states effectively (participants, observers, and delivery team)
- Ensure learning objectives are met every time and follow the group's attention

While flight plans require initial investment to create and maintain, they provide significant benefits over alternatives like unstructured facilitation or rigidscripts. This structured-yet-flexible approach makes delivery more reliable and helps bring new team members up to speed effectively.

Flight plans are used to deliver a consistent Better Conversations experience
for all involved. They ensure:

- The delivery team and any observers follow and discuss the same plan
- The delivery team is well-prepared, discussing their collaboration beforehand
- The learning objectives are met within an agreed timeframe
- New facilitators or producers are effectively supported in their learning and development
- A basis for continuous improvement through session review and identification of areas for refinement

The drawbacks are that they may be time-consuming to create and maintain. This includes delivery planning, content creation, and documentation. 

Flight plans can be perceived as constraining by facilitators (who might feel they reduce spontaneity), or producers who need to adhere strictly to the plan. Our experience is that most facilitators and producers find them useful and helpful once they get used to them.

The alternative is to not use a flight plan, relying instead on the experience 
and intuition of the delivery team. While this can work with professionals who *work frequently and well together*, it is less reliable and significantly increases the difficulty of both facilitator and producer roles. It also hinders onboarding new team members effectively. These factors can significantly degrade the participant experience and make consistent, high-quality delivery challenging to achieve.

Core Components:

**Flight plan content:**

- **Session overview notes:** Brief notes for the facilitator and producer outlining the session's purpose, flow, and key objectives.
- **Preparation checklists:** Checklists for individual and team preparation, including e.g., technical checks, demonstration readiness, handovers.
- **Learning objectives:** Clearly defined learning objectives for the session, including potential extension activities.
- **Detailed time plan:** A minute-by-minute timeline with planned activities for each member of the delivery team, ensuring efficient session pacing.
- **Producer information:** Specific instructions for the producer regarding breakout room setup, Zoom chat content, and technical session management.
- **Facilitator script (guideline):** A detailed script for the facilitator to follow as a guide, ensuring consistent messaging and coverage of key points, while allowing for adaptation and personal style.

**Supporting tools and processes:**

- Observation templates and checklists: Structured tools for observers to gather feedback on session delivery.
- Time management tools: Timers, visual cues, or software to aid in adhering to the time plan.
- State tracking mechanisms: Methods for monitoring participant engagement, learning progress, and session flow (e.g., using chat, polls, or visual dashboards).
- Quality assurance frameworks: Processes for reviewing and maintaining the quality of flight plans and session delivery.
- Feedback collection tools: Surveys, reflection prompts, or feedback forms for gathering participant and delivery team input.

The flight plans themselves are composed of design patterns.  We employ design patterns for each key component of the flight plan, such as the time plan structure, the script, the articulation of learning objectives, and even within specific session sections.  For example, the State Check-In activity is a recurring pattern within many flight plans, the way we introduce breakout rooms is based on a pattern.

This layered approach means that we can continuously improve the flight plan by
refining these constituent design patterns.  Furthermore, these patterns can be
reused and adapted in other contexts, extending their value beyond just flight plan design – and you can do the same!

:material-outlined:`groups;1.8rem` Design roles
-----------------------------------------------

Each of these roles may be performed by a single person, or a team of people.

**Sponsor:**

Understanding the Sponsor's role is key to designing and adapting a flight plan that meets the needs of the commissioning organisation.

The Sponsor represents the stakeholder(s) commissioning the course delivery. This can be:

- An organization funding the training
- A department within a larger organization
- Multiple stakeholders with shared interests

Key responsibilities include:

- Strategic oversight and funding
- Defining business outcomes and success metrics
- Setting organizational constraints (budget, timeline, participant numbers)
- Approving course design and delivery approach
- Providing domain expertise and context
- Ensuring alignment with organizational goals

In larger organizations, Sponsors often delegate operational responsibilities to a designated manager (the Client) who:

- Acts as the primary point of contact
- Coordinates logistics and scheduling
- Manages participant enrollment
- Provides ongoing feedback
- Ensures delivery meets organizational needs

The Sponsor(s) and Client(s) are the people who determine whether the course delivery is successful (or not).

**Course Designer:**

The Course Designer shapes the learning journey by crafting an effective and engaging experience that meets both participant needs and organizational goals.

Core responsibilities include:

- Defining clear learning objectives and outcomes
- Selecting and sequencing appropriate design patterns
- Creating a coherent learning journey that builds progressively
- Establishing measurable success criteria

The Designer ensures effective learning through careful attention to:

- Active participation strategies
- Clear and concise instructions
- Appropriate session pacing
- Strategic knowledge checks
- Meaningful practice opportunities
- Regular reflection points

While our courses are primarily experiential and self-directed, the Designer must:

- Review and improve patterns based on delivery feedback
- Maintain consistent design standards across courses
- Document design decisions and rationale
- Balance structure with flexibility

We intentionally avoid formal assessments to maintain focus on experiential learning. However, the design includes opportunities for self-reflection and peer feedback, and educators can adapt the materials to include their own assessment activities if desired.

**Content Developer:**

The Content Developer brings the course design to life by creating and maintaining the materials that support the learning experience. Their work ensures that participants and delivery teams have everything they need for successful sessions.

Core responsibilities include:

- Creates learning materials and activities
- Writes instructions and guides
- Develops supporting resources
- Ensures consistency across materials

Quality assurance is central to their role:

- Implements quality standards
- Maintains content accuracy
- Reviews pattern implementations
- Validates learning approaches

The Content Developer also plays a crucial coordination role:

- Coordinates with other courses
- Ensures alignment between materials
- Maintains documentation standards
- Supports the evolution of shared patterns

-----------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`sync;1.8rem` Improvement process
-----------------------------------------------------

We maintain a systematic approach to evolving our flight plans:

**Pattern Development:**
Flight plans improve through structured feedback and testing. After each session,
we gather delivery feedback, test improvements, and document variations. This
learning gets incorporated into future versions.

**Version Management:**
We maintain master versions of flight plans with controlled access. For each live
session, we create a working copy that the delivery team can adapt as needed. This
approach provides:

- Clear documentation trails
- Version control
- Flexibility for session-specific needs
- Quality consistency

We previously included additional documentation directly in the flight plans, such as
participant lists, flipchart captures, breakout room configurations, chat logs and
detailed observations. These aspects are now managed through dedicated patterns
(:ref:`flight-plan-data-pattern` and :ref:`flight-plan-quality-pattern`) to better
handle data protection requirements and support our work with external clients.
