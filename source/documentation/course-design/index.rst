Course Design
=============

Design is a term that can mean different things, such as:

- The **purpose, intention, or goal** of something
- The **creation, planning, or arrangement** of an object, a process, or a 
system, according to a specific purpose, function, or context.
- The **plan behind** an action, fact, or object.
- A **pattern** or a **style** of something.

Design is about finding better ways to do things. It's both a science and an
art, a blend of logic, analysis, and utility, as well as intuition,
imagination, and creativity.


Design principles guide our decisions
-------------------------------------

We've also developed a set of design principles that guide our decisions. These
principles are based on our understanding of how adults learn, and on our
experience of designing and delivering other courses. The principles are:

**Separate information from learning**: We've designed the course to separate
information from learning, so that participants can learn by doing, and by
reflecting on what they've done. We've designed the course to be delivered in a
way that encourages participants to engage with the material, with each other,
and with the facilitator.

.. _magic-in-conversations:

**The magic happens in the conversations**: We've designed the course to focus
on the conversations that participants have with each other, and with the
facilitator. We've designed the course to be delivered in a way that encourages
participants to engage with the material, with each other, and with the
facilitator.

**Keep it simple**: We've designed the course to explain the models and
concepts in 5 minutes or less, so that participants can understand and remember
what they've learned.

**Think systemically**: We've always tried to think a few steps ahead, to
dare to dream big and to think about our overall mission. Some of the decisions
we've may seem odd or unnecessary at first, but they are all part of a
longer-term plan. You can always ask us if you're not sure why we've done
something a particular way!

**Always be learning**: We have a tight learning loop, where we gather
feedback, reflect on it, and make changes. We're always looking for ways to
improve the course, and we're always learning from our experiences.

**Know when to be systematic** Whilst learning and adaptation requires an
ability to hold many things in play at once, there are times when it is helpful
to standardise and introduce consistency. We've built systems, processes and
tools that help us to deliver the course in a reliable and scalable way.

Design constraints
------------------

We've decided to work within certain constraints. It may seem counterintuitive,
but these constraints actually help us to be more creative and to make better
decisions. For example:

**We deliver the course online**: This means that we can reach a global
audience, and also reach people who might be working remotely or who might not
be able to travel to a training course.

**We deliver the course in 6 modules**: This means that we have to be
selective about what we include in the course. It also means there are
opportunities for people who want to go deeper to do so, by adding extra modules
that are tailored to their audience.

**Each module is delivered in one hour**: This means that we have to be
concise and focused in the way we deliver the course. It's led to a repeatable
pattern of delivery that we can rely on.

**We limit 'teaching' time**: This means that we have to be clear in the way
we explain the models and concepts, remove any unnecessary detail, and simplify
the material as much as possible (which is harder than it looks!). It also
means we maximise the time for participants to practice and reflect.


Design features
---------------

We've developed this course over hundreds of hours of design, development, and
delivery. We've iterated and improved it based on feedback from participants
and facilitators. We've also drawn on our experience of designing and
delivering other courses, and our understanding of how adults learn. The output
of all that work is a course that is designed to be:

**Accessible and flexible**: We want a wide range of people to enjoy this
course and for it to be useful in different contexts. We've designed it to be
delivered online, in English, and in a modular format. We've also designed it
to be flexible, so that you can adapt it to your own needs, for example by
using different tools, delivering it in another language, or delivering it in a
different way. We encourage you to adapt the course to your own needs, and to
share your experiences with us.

**Interactive and experiential**: Participants can learn by doing, and by
reflecting on what they've done. We've designed it to be delivered in a way
that encourages participants to engage with the material, with each other, and
with the facilitator.

**Consistent and scalable**: Colleagues who do the course at different times
will learn the same things. We've designed it to be scalable, so that it can be
delivered to diverse participants across cultures and contexts.

**Robust and reliable**: It's important to use that the material worls with
diverse participants across cultures and contexts. We've designed it to support
employees with any behaviour change that is needed for better conversations,
and to be relevant and easy to apply in business situations.

**Relevant and easy to apply**: We want the content of the course to be
relevant and easy to apply in business situations. We've designed it to support
employees with any behaviour change that is needed for better conversations,
and to be relevant and easy to apply in business situations.

**Engaging and Actionable**: We strive to be clear, concise and for the skills
to be actionable, so that participants are motivated to use what they've
learned immediately. We know people apply new skills when they are relevant to
their circumstances.

    - This section has been compiled with the help of CoPilot so needs a good edit
    - Make the link to assumptions and context; design is all about these.
    - Review and include more design principles
    - Would be nice to explain the design principles then link to the guidance e.g. seperate information from learning and put it in handbook
    - Features and benefits - are we going to list them here?
    - Add link to handbook?
    - do we need separate sections?
