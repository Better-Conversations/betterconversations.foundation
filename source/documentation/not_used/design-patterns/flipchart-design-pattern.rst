:material-outlined:`construction;1.8rem` Using this pattern
-----------------------------------------------------------

Flipcharts are a core tool in Better Conversations course design. They provide a structured way to support learning objectives while maintaining engagement and creating shared understanding. This pattern explains how flipcharts contribute to learning outcomes and why they are integral to our course design.

This pattern addresses these learning challenges:

- How to structure information visually
- Ways to maintain participant engagement


Alternative approaches might include slides or digital whiteboards, but these lack the immediacy and engagement that physical flipcharts provide. We use flipcharts to enable learning and help the facilitator to manage the conversation. We have found that it is not necessary for participants to be able to read every word on the flipchart. It is a way of demonstrating that the facilitator has heard what the participants have said and has made it visible to everyone.

:material-outlined:`design_services;1.8rem` Form
------------------------------------------------

**Visual Structure:**

- Write the title clearly at the top of the flipchart
- Reproduce the models used in the course handbook closely
- Where possible, allow for reuse of the flipchart

**Information Types:**

- Reference where the models you use are found in the course handbook
- When using the flipchart to capture key insights from the group, use the participants' own words and phrases to demonstrate that the facilitator has heard what the participants have said and has made it visible to everyone
- Plan to record key insights from 3-4 participants (not everything that is said)
- Use the flipchart in conjunction with the chat facility to allow all participants to contribute even when time is limited and there is not enough space on the flipchart to write down everything that is said

**Colour System:**

- When related models are presented over multiple modules, ensure that the colours used are consistent i.e. the same colour for the same part of the model
- When unpacking the breakout activities with multiple questions to the group, use different colours for answers to each question and/or section the flipchart by question
- When using the flipchart to capture key insights from the group (where only one question is asked), use different colours for each participant's contribution

:material-outlined:`groups;1.8rem` Design roles
-----------------------------------------------

These roles may be held by the same person or split across a team. See the 
:ref:`roles-design-pattern` for detailed descriptions of:

- **Course Designer:** Creates the learning journey
- **Content Developer:** Develops and maintains materials

Common variations
-----------------

Some facilitators prefer to print the flipchart pages for the course overview/agenda and models on a large sheet of paper. 

You could also use presentation software to display the content. This is useful if you are delivering in-person in a context where a flipchart is not availavle and/or participants *expect* to see slides. Be mindful of the trade-off between ease of presentation *for the facilitator* and the participant engagement that a physical flipchart provides.


Practical examples

You can find the latest published flipchart examples here

.. todo::

   TO DO Add link to flipchart examples
   TO DO Consider adding video examples

Generally these include pages for:

- Course overview and agenda
- Model for the session topic
- Breakout room unpacking

We reuse across different modules to  minimise the number of pages required per session.

:material-outlined:`touch_app;1.8rem` Setup and requirements
------------------------------------------------------------

Materials and resources
-----------------------

- Flipcharts should be large enough to be visible to all participants
- Use a flipchart stand for stability (we have known cases where they have fallen over!)
- Good quality squared or dotted paper helps with layout and prevents bleed through from the markers
- Use a pencil to outline the models on the paper before going over with markers
- Use good quality chisel tip markers designed for flipcharts in red, orange, green, blue and black as a minimum colour set (this will help the camera to focus the flipchart properly)
- Practise large and legible lettering (2-3cm high)
- Use good quality sticky notes where explaining models (see examples) and have a glue stick to hand if they drop off
- Always have 1 or 2 extra blank pages for spontaneous capture

-------------------------------------------------------------------  

Implementation considerations
-----------------------------

- Make sure you can see the flipchart in the camera view (this usually means 50% of the frame will be showing the flipchart, and 50% the facilitator).
- Consider storage of the flipchart and stand when not in use.
- Review your camera and lighting setup to ensure good picture quality with the flipchart and facilitator in the frame together.
- Test your camera and lighting setup with the flipchart before the session, in the same room, and at the same time of day as the session where possible. Be aware of seasonal changes in daylight quality if you are using natural light.

Design evolution
----------------

Potential evoluations are use of: 

- Alternative technologies (e.g. virtual whiteboards, digital flipcharts)
- Presentation software
- Hybrid facilitation techniques (where facilitators and participants are in a mixed online/in-person environment)
