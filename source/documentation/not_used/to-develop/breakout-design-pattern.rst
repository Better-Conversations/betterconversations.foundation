Breakout rooms are a core tool for facilitating small group discussions and activities in 
Better Conversations online sessions. This pattern describes how we design and structure 
breakout activities to maximize learning and engagement.

-----------------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`construction;1.8rem` Using this pattern
-----------------------------------------------------------

This pattern addresses these learning challenges:

- How to enable small group discussions online
- When to use breakouts vs full group activities
- How to maintain engagement in virtual spaces
- Ways to practice skills in smaller groups
- Methods for peer learning and support

The pattern is particularly valuable when:
- Practicing conversation skills
- Building peer relationships
- Working through exercises
- Discussing sensitive topics
- Encouraging quieter voices

-----------------------------------------------------

Core components:

**Room Structure:**
- Group size considerations
- Duration planning
- Activity design
- Support mechanisms
- Transition points

**Participant Flow:**
- Entry and exit handling
- Activity briefing
- Time management
- Support access
- Debrief process

-----------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`groups;1.8rem` Design roles
-----------------------------------------------

**Course Designer:**
- Plans breakout activities
- Sets group sizes
- Determines timing
- Designs instructions
- Creates support materials

**Producer:**
- Manages room creation
- Handles assignments
- Monitors activity
- Provides technical support
- Coordinates transitions

---------------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`content_paste;1.8rem` Design examples
---------------------------------------------------------

**Basic Implementation:**
- Standard 2-3 person groups
- Clear activity briefing
- Timed exercises
- Support mechanisms
- Debrief structure

**Common Variations:**
- Different group sizes
- Varied durations
- Activity types
- Support approaches
- Debrief methods

--------------------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`co_present;1.8rem` Delivery considerations
--------------------------------------------------------------

Key factors for successful delivery:

- Clear participant instructions
- Producer coordination
- Technical setup needs
- Support mechanisms
- Time management

-------------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`sync;1.8rem` Continuous improvement
-------------------------------------------------------

How to improve the pattern over time:

- Gathering participant feedback
- Refining timing
- Enhancing instructions
- Improving support
- Evolving activities

---------------------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`sticky_note_2;1.8rem` Design considerations
---------------------------------------------------------------

**Critical Factors:**
- Group size impact
- Time constraints
- Technical limitations
- Support requirements
- Activity complexity

.. todo:: Video here, and also explain what the breakout rooms do for us. 
The following content is from the previous version of this pattern and is kept for reference:

We use Breakout Rooms to facilitate small group discussions. Generally
each Better Conversations module has two sections where participants go
into Breakout Rooms.

Some exercises will take longer e.g. practising 2-3 questions. Therefore 
the second breakout may be longer than the first...

Timings and Notifications
-------------------------

Giving a minute longer for me is to give them a minute longer to get to 
know each other on top of what you think each exercise should take. 
This will need to happen again if you change the groups for subsequent breakouts.






Assign breakouts based on state checkin. Post breakout 1, factor in how the individuals are engaging.

Change the groups only if the subsequent exercises don't depend on the first one e.g. if it doesn't involve continuing the conversation.

Change the breakout groups if someone is clearly not engaging or has a tech issue or other need. Consider keeping them in the main room to work with the facilitator on the exercise.

If you know a participant is neurodiverse, consider how to make the questions more meaningful and accessible e.g. by narrowing the context.
