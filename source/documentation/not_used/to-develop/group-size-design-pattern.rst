Group size is a critical factor in Better Conversations course design that impacts delivery 
approach, team composition, and participant experience. This pattern describes how we 
adapt our delivery based on group size to maintain quality and effectiveness.

-----------------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`construction;1.8rem` Using this pattern
-----------------------------------------------------------

This pattern addresses these learning challenges:

- How to maintain engagement at different scales
- When to adjust team composition
- How to ensure quality across group sizes
- Ways to manage larger groups effectively
- Methods for scaling delivery

The pattern is particularly valuable when:
- Planning new sessions
- Scaling existing courses
- Training delivery teams
- Managing resources
- Ensuring quality

:material-outlined:`architecture;1.8rem` Architecture
-----------------------------------------------------

Core components:

**Team Structure:**
- Solo facilitator (up to 4 participants)
- Facilitator + producer (up to 8 participants)
- Co-facilitators + producer (larger groups)
- Multiple producers (very large groups)

**Delivery Adjustments:**
- Time management
- Activity adaptation
- Support provision
- Energy management
- Quality maintenance

-----------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`groups;1.8rem` Design roles
-----------------------------------------------

**Course Designer:**
- Determines team requirements
- Plans scaling approaches
- Adapts activities
- Sets quality standards
- Defines support needs

**Delivery Team:**
- Coordinates roles
- Manages group dynamics
- Provides support
- Maintains engagement
- Ensures quality

---------------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`content_paste;1.8rem` Design examples

**Basic Implementation:**
- Standard team structures
- Core adaptations
- Support frameworks
- Quality controls
- Resource allocation

**Common Variations:**
- Different team compositions
- Scaling approaches
- Support models
- Quality measures
- Resource adjustments

--------------------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`co_present;1.8rem` Delivery considerations
--------------------------------------------------------------

Key factors for successful delivery:

- Team coordination
- Resource allocation
- Support provision

.. note:: Legacy Content Below

The following content is from the previous version of this pattern and is kept for reference:

.. todo::
    - Needs better name
    - 4 on your own, 8 with producer
    - Anything above that we recommend a co-faciliator
        - Keeps interest moving between people
        - Can scribe as people talk, saves time
    - We can help with producers and introductions
    - Flight plans are developed with X assumptions
    - Make sure that's mentioned in the flight plans
    - we're ok up to our Zoom limit of 300 (although we haven't done it)
