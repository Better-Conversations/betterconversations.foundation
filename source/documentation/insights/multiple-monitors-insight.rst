Multiple monitors transform delivery

.. tip:: Consider this
   
   Two monitors dramatically reduce cognitive load and increase effectiveness for facilitators and producers.

What we learned
---------------
Initially, facilitators and producers struggled to manage Zoom, flight plans, and private chat on single laptop screens. Constant window-switching created stress, missed cues, and disrupted flow. When team members used dual monitor setups (a monitor alongside a laptop screen) or a large screen to allow multiple windows to be displayed side-by-side, we saw immediate improvements in delivery smoothness and team coordination.

The difference was particularly notable for producers, who need to simultaneously monitor participants, manage breakout rooms, prepare chat messages, and follow the flight plan. What felt like juggling became orchestration.

Why it matters
--------------
This discovery affects how we:

- Onboard new delivery team members
- Set minimum technical requirements  
- Troubleshoot delivery issues
- Design flight plan layouts
- Prioritize equipment investments

Practical implications
----------------------
Based on this learning:

- We now advise dual monitors as "strongly recommended" for all delivery roles
- We recommend specific screen layouts (Zoom on one screen, flight plan on other)
- We avoid using single-screen setups in our delivery of sessions
