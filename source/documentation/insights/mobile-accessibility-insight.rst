Key insight
-----------
Participants may join from mobile devices, requiring inclusive design approaches.

What we discovered
------------------

We designed Better Conversations assuming participants would join from laptop computers with full Zoom functionality. However, we learned that participants joined from phones and tablets. Some were travelling, others lacked computer access, and some simply preferred mobile devices.

Initially, this created problems. Breakout rooms worked differently on mobile. 
Chat was harder to access. 

The delivery team now notes when participants join from mobile devices, and we make allowances for this, including providing the opportunity to speak rather than type, and ensuring that breakout room pairings are made so that one person is on a laptop which gives easier access to the breakout instructions in the chat.

Why it matters
--------------
This discovery impacts:

- Exercise design and instructions
- Communication between facilitators and participants
- Facilitator language choices
- Accessibility and inclusion

Practical implications
----------------------
Based on this learning, we

- Always mention "on computer or mobile" when giving instructions
- Allow verbal alternatives to chat-based activities
- Check that people are safe to use their mobile devices if they appear to be travelling
