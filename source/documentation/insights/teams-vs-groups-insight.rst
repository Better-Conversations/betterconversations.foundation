Intact Teams Need Different Approaches
================================================

.. tags:: insights, team delivery, psychological safety, group dynamics, adaptation

Key insight
-----------
Existing relationships and hierarchies significantly affect session dynamics and require adapted delivery approaches.

What we discovered
------------------
When delivering Better Conversations to intact organisational teams, are very aware of the team dynamics compared to open course sessions (where participants are part of a group rather than a team). 

Why it matters
--------------
This insight affects:

- Pre-session sponsor conversations
- Breakout room pairing strategies
- Facilitator language and framing
- Exercise selection and adaptation
- Expectations for sharing depth

Practical implications
----------------------
We:

- Always discuss team dynamics and links to wider organisational strategy/needs with sponsors before team sessions
- Respect the roles, team culture and structure
- Be very aware of our role in the engagement - we are not there to 'fix' the team
