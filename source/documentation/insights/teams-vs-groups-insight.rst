Intact teams need different approaches

.. tip::
   
   Existing relationships and hierarchies significantly affect session dynamics and require different approaches.

What we learned
------------------
When delivering Better Conversations to intact organisational teams (i.e. teams that exist before and continue to work together after we have delivered the course), we are very aware of the team dynamics. This requires a different approach to open course sessions (where we are generally working with a group of individuals who may not have worked together before, and may not continue to meet after the course).

Why it matters
--------------
This insight affects:

- Pre-session sponsor conversations
- Breakout room pairing strategies
- Facilitator language and framing
- Exercise selection and adaptation
- Expectations for sharing depth

Practical implications
----------------------
We:

- Always discuss team dynamics and links to wider organisational strategy/needs with sponsors before team sessions
- Respect the roles, team culture and structure
- Be very aware of our role in the engagement - we are not there to 'fix' the team
