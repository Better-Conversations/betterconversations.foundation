Individual Preparation Before Sessions Is Critical

Key insight
-----------
What happens BEFORE the 30-minute briefing also determines session success.

What we discovered
------------------
Sometimes the best preparation is done by the individual facilitator and producer. We've all had issues with audio, video and internet connection so we advise people that deliver with us to check their equipment before the delivery team briefing. If we know someone is having recurring issues, we can help them resolve these before the briefing, or we can rearrange the co-facilitation roles to help.

Why it matters
--------------
This insight affects:

- Team member expectations and contracts
- Good use of the briefing time
- New facilitator onboarding
- Session quality predictability
- Team psychological safety

Practical implications
----------------------
Based on this learning, we:

- Have a checklist for individual preparation to support people
- Have contingencies for when equipment is not working
