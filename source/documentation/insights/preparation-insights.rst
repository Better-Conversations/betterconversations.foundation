Individual Preparation is Crucial

   What happens *before* the 30-minute briefing also determines session success.

What we learned
------------------
Sometimes the best preparation is done by the individual facilitator and producer. We've all had issues with audio, video and internet connection (and continue to do so from time to time)so we advise people that deliver with us to check their equipment before the delivery team briefing. 

If we know someone is having recurring issues, we can help them resolve these before the briefing, or we can rearrange the co-facilitation/production roles to help. It's a state thing as well - sometimes we're all in a good place, sometimes we're not. The delivery team is there to support each other.

Why it matters
--------------
This insight affects:

- Team member expectations and "soft" contracting through the delivery team briefing and checklist
- New facilitator/producer onboarding
- Session quality
- Team psychological safety

Practical implications
----------------------
Based on this learning, we have:

- A checklist for individual preparation to support people
- Contingencies for when equipment is not working
- Clear decision-making roles for what happens if there are issues - it's usually the producer who will make the call on what to do next
