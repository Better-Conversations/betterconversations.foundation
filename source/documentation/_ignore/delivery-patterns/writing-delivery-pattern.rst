Writing a Delivery Pattern
==========================
.. note::

    Delivery patterns are core, reusable solutions to common problems in the delivery of the Better Conversations course concerned mainly with facilitation, production, and managing session flow.

    This section gives some guidance on how to write a delivery pattern for this site. It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to delivery patterns, but will give you a starting point. In each section below, choose what is relevant to your pattern and replace the text. You don't have to use all the suggested sections, but it is important that you include all the sections that are relevant to your pattern. 
    
    Name the pattern with a short title (verb-noun format is useful)

-----------------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`construction;1.8rem` Using this pattern
-----------------------------------------------------------

Explain the pattern's purpose and value in course delivery:

- What delivery challenges does it solve?
- How does it support session flow?
- When is it most effective?
- What are the drawbacks or limitations?
- What alternatives might be considered?

--------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`route;1.8rem` Flow
--------------------------------------

Describe the delivery process:

- What are the key steps and sequence?
- What are the timing considerations?
- What are the decision points?
- What are the adaptation options?
- What are the success indicators?

-------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`groups;1.8rem` Delivery roles
-------------------------------------------------

    
**Facilitators:**

- What are the key actions and decisions?
- What are the timing considerations?
- What are the adaptation responsibilities?
- What are the quality management responsibilities?

**Producers:**

- What are the technical requirements?
- What are the support actions?
- What are the coordination points?
- What are the resource management responsibilities?

**Participants:**

- What is expected of participants?
- What support is needed?
- What are the success indicators?
- What are the common challenges?

----------------------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`content_paste;1.8rem` Examples and resources
----------------------------------------------------------------

Provide practical delivery adaptations that have been learned from applying it within different contexts. Consider the following:

Delivery Materials
------------------

- What session templates are there?
- What delivery guides are there?
- What checklists are there?
- What participant materials are there?
- What observation forms are there?
- What feedback collection tools are there?

Practical Examples
------------------

- What real-world anecdotes or examples are there 
relevant to delivery?
- What are some lessons learned specific to delivery?

----------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`touch_app;1.8rem` Implementation
----------------------------------------------------

- What technical requirements are there?
- What preparation steps are needed?
- What checks are needed?
- What resources are needed?
- What timing considerations are needed?
- What quality management responsibilities are needed?

-------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`checklist;1.8rem` Evaluation
-------------------------------------------------

- What indicators are there for success?
- How can you check the quality of the delivery?
- What feedback collection mechanisms are there?

---------------------------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`sticky_note_2;1.8rem` Additional delivery factors
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- What special cases are known?
- What are scaling approaches can be used?
- What are some common challenges and pitfalls, and how can they be avoided?
- What risks must be managed?
- What are some support requirements?

----------------------------------------------------
:material-outlined:`sync;1.8rem` Improvement process
----------------------------------------------------

Consider the following process for improving the pattern:

1. **Collect and analyze**

   - Use structured observation templates
   - Gather implementation data
   - Identify recurring issues
   - Map dependencies

2. **Plan and prioritize**

   - Evaluate impact vs effort
   - Set implementation roadmap
   - Allocate resources

3. **Implement and validate**

   - Test changes in a controlled environment
   - Document outcomes
   - Share results

.. to do::

   TODO Compare this to the continuous improvement pattern.
