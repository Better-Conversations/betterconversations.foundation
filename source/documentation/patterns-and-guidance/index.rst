Patterns and Guidance
=====================

What we've learned
==================

Through thousands of hours designing and delivering Better Conversations, we've discovered what works reliably and what needs adjusting for context. We're sharing our experience to help you deliver the course effectively while honoring your own style.

What works reliably (patterns)
==============================

When we've tested something across many sessions and found it consistently effective, we document it as a "pattern" - a term borrowed from software development. These patterns represent proven approaches to common situations in Better Conversations delivery.

Our patterns aren't rules or requirements. They're reliable solutions we've refined through experience. We encourage you to try them as described first - they work because specific elements combine in specific ways. Once you understand why they work, you'll be better equipped to adapt them to your context.

Where style and preference matter (guidance)
============================================

Some aspects of delivery are more flexible, influenced by facilitator style, group dynamics, or context. We document these as "guidance" notes - different approaches we've seen work well, each with its own benefits.

Guidance acknowledges that skilled delivery teams might choose different paths to the same destination. We share multiple approaches so you can find what aligns with your natural style while serving your participants effectively.

Why we share this information
=============================

Transparency matters to us. By documenting both our reliable patterns and flexible guidance, we:

- Help you understand the thinking behind course design decisions
- Support your development as a facilitator and/or producer
- Encourage informed adaptation rather than guesswork
- Build a community of practice where we all learn together

Your experience matters too!
============================

These patterns and guidance aren't set in stone. They evolve as we learn. If you discover variations that work well, or if something doesn't work in your context, we want to know! Your experience contributes to the collective learning that makes Better Conversations better for everyone.

Whether you're delivering our course or designing your own, these patterns provide tested starting points. Use what serves you, adapt what needs adapting, and please share what you learn with us. You can do this by `contacting us directly <https://betterconversations.org/contact/>`_ or by `posting in our community <https://betterconversations.org/community/>`_ (if you have already signed up with us)..
