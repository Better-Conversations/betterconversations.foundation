Multiple Monitors Transform Delivery
====================================

**Context:** Discovered through remote delivery challenges in 2020-2021
**Key Learning:** Two monitors dramatically reduce cognitive load for delivery teams

What we discovered
------------------
Initially, facilitators and producers struggled to manage Zoom, flight plans, and 
private chat on single screens. Constant window-switching created stress, missed 
cues, and disrupted flow. When team members upgraded to dual monitor setups, we 
saw immediate improvements in delivery smoothness and team coordination.

The difference was particularly notable for producers, who need to simultaneously 
monitor participant gallery view, manage breakout rooms, prepare chat messages, 
and follow the flight plan. What felt like juggling became orchestration.

Why it matters
--------------
This discovery affects how we:

- Onboard new delivery team members
- Set minimum technical requirements  
- Troubleshoot delivery issues
- Design flight plan layouts

Practical implications
----------------------
Based on this learning:

- We now list dual monitors as "strongly recommended" for all delivery roles
- We recommend specific screen layouts (Zoom on one screen, flight plan on other)
- We avoid assuming single-screen setups in our instructions
