## 🎨 Design System

- **Brand Colors**: Primary teal (`#54C4B6`) and secondary green (`#A8D381`)
- **Consistent Gradients**: `from-[#54C4B6] to-[#A8D381]` pattern throughout
- **Global CSS Classes**: `.bcf-*` prefix for consistent components (see `src/styles/global.css`)
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with generous spacing
- **Typography**: Sentence case for headings, title case for buttons

See [docs/design-system.md](./docs/design-system.md) for complete specifications.

## 📝 Content Management

### Blog Posts

Create markdown files in `src/content/blog/` with required frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
pubDate: 2024-01-15
author: "Author Name"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
excerpt: "Brief description for cards and listings"
---
```

### Images

- **Blog hero images**: Place in `/src/assets/images/blog/` as `[slug]-hero.{ext}` (auto-optimized)
- **Author photos**: Place in `/src/assets/images/authors/` as `[firstname-lastname].{ext}`
- **General images**: Place in `/src/assets/images/` for automatic optimization

See [docs/content-guidelines.md](./docs/content-guidelines.md) for complete guidelines.

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Content Collections**: Blog posts managed through Astro's content collections with schema validation
- **File-based Routing**: Automatic route generation from the `src/pages/` directory
- **Client-Side Search**: Fast, interactive search with advanced filtering (Typesense-powered)
- **SEO Optimized**: Sitemap generation, robots.txt, structured data (JSON-LD), OpenGraph tags
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Server-rendered content enhanced with Alpine.js for interactivity
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliant with keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## ⚠️ Current Status

- ✅ **Blog**: Live and active with 8+ posts
- ✅ **Static Pages**: All main navigation pages complete
- ⚠️ **Whitepapers**: Currently hidden (directories prefixed with `_whitepapers`)
- ⚠️ **Search**: Functional but has 2 TODOs (API key and collection name - see [SearchTypesense.astro](src/components/SearchTypesense.astro))

## 🤝 Contributing

When making changes:

1. **Check documentation first** - See [/docs/](./docs/) for comprehensive guidelines
2. **Run `npx astro check`** after TypeScript/Astro file changes (must pass)
3. **Use UK English spelling** in all content (organisation, colour, centre)
4. **Check global `.bcf-*` classes** before creating custom styles
5. **Test responsive design** on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
6. **Test accessibility** with keyboard navigation and screen readers

### Critical Development Rules

- **TypeScript**: Scripts with `define:vars` must use `is:inline` and plain JavaScript only
- **Accessibility**: All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
- **Mobile-first**: Always start with mobile styles, enhance for larger screens
- **UK English**: Content only (never change code syntax like CSS properties)

See [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for quick reference or [docs/development.md](./docs/development.md) for details.
