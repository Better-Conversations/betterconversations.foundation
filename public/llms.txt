# Better Conversations Foundation

> A nonprofit making evidence-based communication skills accessible to every team, learner, and organisation — for free, under Creative Commons.

Better Conversations Foundation (BCF) develops and freely shares a practical six-hour course that helps people listen better, ask better questions, and have more productive conversations at work. All materials are open source under CC BY-SA 4.0. We partner with organisations, educators, and researchers who want to build lasting internal capacity rather than rely on external trainers.
